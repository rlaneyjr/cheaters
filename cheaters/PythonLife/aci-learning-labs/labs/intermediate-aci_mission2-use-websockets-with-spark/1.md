# Mission: Use Websockets to Send Notifications to Spark
As Superheroes and Villains continues to grow, there is increasing demand to quickly isolate and resolve incidents. Since they have deployed ACI in their new datacenter, your boss has decided to leverage its programming capabliities to meet these requirements.

You have been asked to have the events in the ACI fabric push notifications to a Spark room (the lab proctor will provide the Room ID). This is the perfect opportunity to impress the boss with what you have learned about using websockets with ACI.

#### Credentials File
We use a `credentials.py` file in this lab to authenticate with the APIC. If you are following along with your own device, then we suggest creating this file and saving it in your working directory. The file should look like this with updated parameters for your environment:
```
URL = 'https://198.18.133.200'
LOGIN = 'admin'
PASSWORD = 'C1sco12345'
```

We have also provided this file with the our Dashboard Application in the sample code repo.

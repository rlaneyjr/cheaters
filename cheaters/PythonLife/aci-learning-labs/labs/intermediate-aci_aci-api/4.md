#### Query Filters
The ACI API has robust filtering options, and allows for up to 20 different expressions per query. Here are a few of the query filter expressions:

| Operator | Description |
| ---------|:-----------:|
| eq    | Equal to |
| ne    | Not equal to |
| lt    | Less than |
| gt    | Greater than |
| le    | Less than or equal to |
| ge    | Greater than or equal to |
| not   | Logical inverse |
| and   | Logical AND |
| or    | Logical OR |
| wcard | Wildcard |


Now open Postman and try a few of these to see how it works.

In order to connect with the APIC you will need to use POST with the authentication parameters:

```json
HTTP Method: POST
URL: `https://198.18.133.200/api/aaaLogin.json`
Body:
{
    "aaaUser": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "admin",
            "pwd": "C1sco12345"
        }
    }
}
```

You should see a 200 OK response in Postman. If you do not, check that the URL, Username, and Password are correct.

![Postman Login](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/postman_login.png)

First you will do a GET request using the URI from the filtered fvTenant query.

The URL provided below has removed the `and` after `query-target-filter`. This "and" is used as a "Logical AND" which checks that two or more conditions are met; this query only has 1 filter, so it is not required. Also, `.xml` has been changed to `.json`, but either option would work. Do a GET request with this URL: `https://198.18.133.200/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=eq(fvTenant.name,"Heroes")`

Using Postman, peform the following request:
```
HTTP Method: GET
URL: `https://198.18.133.200/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=eq(fvTenant.name,"Heroes")`
```

![Postman Get Tenant Heroes](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/postman_get_tenant_heroes.png)

With the JSON formatted response you can see that the dictionary key/value pairs correspond exactly to the attributes shown in Visore. This filter did a comparison to the "name" attribute.

Perform another Postman request using the "dn" attribute in addition to the "name" attriubute. The syntax for filtering is `class.attribute,"value"`. You will need to add the "and" keyword back this time since we are comparing two values.  Update the URL in Postman to the following:

```
https://198.18.133.200/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=and(eq(fvTenant.name,"Heroes"),eq(fvTenant.dn,"uni/tn-Heroes"))
```

Execute the request, and the APIC will return the same results.

Now change the "dn" to "uni/tn-Heros" and re-run the request. This time the APIC will accept this as a valid request (the APIC responds with a "200 OK"), but it returns zero results.

![Postman Get Tenant Failed](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/postman_get_tenant_failed.png)

The reason this failed is that the "Logical AND" operator was used, and no Tenant object met both conditions. Go ahead and use the following URL that uses **or** instead: 

```
https://198.18.133.200/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=or(eq(fvTenant.name,"Heroes"),eq(fvTenant.dn,"uni/tn-Heros"))
```

Execute another request in Postman with this new URL.

You should see the Heroes Tenant again since "Logical OR" tests only that at least one of the conditions is met.

These examples are all testing for equality, but you can also test for inequality. A network admin might want to see what Tenants exist on the Fabric besides the default Tenants of "common", "infra", and "mgmt." 

In order to show this, put the following URL in Postman and see what Tenants have been configured:

```
https://198.18.133.200/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=and(ne(fvTenant.name,"common"),ne(fvTenant.name,"infra"),ne(fvTenant.name,"mgmt"))
```


This example uses the "and" and "ne" opperators to filter out the undesired results.

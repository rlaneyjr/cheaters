#### Query Scopes
Take another look back at Visore; you should still have the "fvTenant" search opened. If you look at the "dn" value in the Heroes Tenant, you should see a couple of green arrows.

The left arrow jumps back one class closer to root, and the right arrow jumps into all objects of the Heroes Tenant's children. Click the right arrow.

If you look at all of the peach colored headings, you should notice that they list out the different classes under Tenant, and this looks identical to the JSON that was built out at the beginning of this lab. This means that you can browse through objects in Visore and see how they are related, what attributes they have, and how to construct JSON or XML files for configurations(clicking "Display last response" actually provides the XML values).

Clicking the arrow on the DN also changed our query from searching by class to searching by DN. The URI tips us off to this by changing the third section from **class** to **mo**. We usually think searching by DN as returning only one result since a DN is unique, however this URI uses **Scoping Filters** to expand the query to its chidlren. This is the same method used when downloading configurations from the GUI and setting the content and scope. Here are a few options:

*  **query-target**={self|children|subtree}
    -  self is the MO itself
    -  children is just the MO's child objects
    -  subtree contains the MO and its child objects
*   **target-subtree-class**=[list of 1 or more sub-classess of the MO]
    -   only returns child objects of the specified classes
*   **rsp-subtree**={no|children|full}
    -   no is the default and the response does not include any children
    -   children will return only the child objects
    -   full includes the full tree structure
*   **query-target-filter**=filter expression (this was reviewed above)
*   **rsp-prop-include**={all|naming-only|config-only}
    -   all returns all properties of the objects
    -   naming-only returns only the naming properties
    -   config-only returns only properties that are configurable

In addition to using many filter expressions in the same request, you can also combine several scoping filters by using the "&" symbol.

Navigate back to Postman and query for the class fvTenant with a name equal to "Heroes"; obtain the full branch, but only configuration values. 

Use this URL:

```
https://apic/api/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=eq(fvTenant.name,"Heroes")&rsp-subtree=full&rsp-prop-include=config-only
```

Visore is great for browsing through the MIT and for obtaining query URIs, but it requires some assembly to do either POST or DELETE requests. There is another tool, the API Inspector, that will help us construct full POST or Delete requests and still aid in showing GET request URLs too.

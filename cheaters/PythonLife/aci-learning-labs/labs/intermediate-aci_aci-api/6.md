### API Inspector
The API Inspector is built into the APIC and is used to capture API requests being made to the controller. Remember that the APIC GUI is itself an API client and makes API requests to the underlying APIC controllers.   The API Inspector allows you to _sniff_ these requests to see which API calls are being made.  

Let's get started and learn how to use the API Inspector.

Ensure you are logged into the APIC controllers.

In the APIC GUI, click on the "Welcome" dropdown and choose **Show API Inspector**.

![Launch API Inspector](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/launch_api_inspector.png)

This launches a new window that will list the API requests as they are made. Uncheck **Scroll to latest** so the logs do not auto-scroll.

Click around in the GUI a few times; you'll start seeing some GET requests appear in the Inspector window. 

Now click on the Tenants tab.  You'll see the following in the Inspector window as soon you as you click it:

```
method: GET
url: https://apic/api/node/class/fvTenant.json?query-target-filter=or(eq(...
response: {"totalCount": ...
```

These are going to look similar to the URIs and responses that we saw in Visore, and used in Postman. 

Now Create a new Tenant in the GUI by:

1.  Click on **Add Tenant**
2.  Name the Tenant "Villains"
3.  Name the VRF "Villains_Only"
4.  Click **Submit**

You'll see a POST request in the API Inspector window. You can also search for "post" in the API Inspector search bar.

```
method: POST
url: https://apic/api/node/mo/uni/tn-Villains.json
payload{"fvTenant":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Villains","name":"Villains","rn":"tn-Villains","status":"created"},"children":[{"fvCtx":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Villains/ctx-Villains_Only","name":"Villains_Only","rn":"ctx-Villains_Only","status":"created"},"children":[]}}]}}
response: {"totalCount":"0","imdata":[]}
```

The information displayed in the Inspector window is needed for the next task; specfically the URL and Payload. We will use the URL and Payload to create this Tenant using Postman; copy this information to a text editor.

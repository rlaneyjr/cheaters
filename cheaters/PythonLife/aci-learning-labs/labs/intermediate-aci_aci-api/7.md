#### API URL
We have already had you do a few GET requests, but we haven't really talked about the URL. The first portion is always the same: protocol, apic address, and operator ("api"). It will look something like `https://apic/api` or sometimes `https://apic/api/node`.

The next two sections of the URL depends on if the API call is a Class-based or DN-based API call, just as you learned when using Visore.

If the API call is a Class-based query, you use `/class/<class-name>`.

If the API call is a DN-based query, you use `/mo/<dn>`.

> Note: POST requests will always use `/mo/<dn>` since you're effectively making a change to a specific managed object.
 
The last required portion, which is a file extension, dictates the encoding format requested by the API client.

You can choose to use `.xml` or `.json` thus choosing to use XML or JSON data encoding.  

You can optionally add query filters as we showed during the Visore lab.

#### API POSTS
With this understanding of the URL, you can look at the request you just copied from API Inspector and see that it uses `/mo/<dn>` since it is using POST; the DN is `uni/tn-Villains`. 

When doing POST requests, it is generally a good practice to choose the payload's "Content-Type"; since the Inspector uses JSON, choose `JSON(application/json)`, and while we show that here, it is NOT used since APIC requires the use of the file extension to dictate the Content-Type and Accept-Type headers.


![Postman Select JSON](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/postman_select_json.png)

Copy the URL and Body into Postman and send the POST request. 

![Postman Config Error](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/postman_config_error.png)

You'll get a "400 Bad Request" response, and the content informs us that the Tenant "Villains" already exists. 

This is not bad, but it does illustrate that ACI will not try creating an object that already exists.

> Note: you can change the `status` flag to "modified" from "created" and a 400 Bad request would not occur and this would highlight the fact that the API when using "modified" is idempotent, meaning you can make the same request N times and it'll only be implemented the first time.

While in the APIC GUI, delete the exisiting "Villains" Tenant.

Make sure you still have API Inspector open (you might want to click clear to get a clean window), and in the GUI:

1.  Right-click on **Tenant Villains**
2.  Choose **Delete**

![GUI Delete Tenant](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/gui_delete_tenant.png)

The API Inspector should show something similar to the Tenant creation request, but the "status" attribute has a value of "deleted".

```
method: POST
url: https://apic/api/node/mo/uni.json
payload{"polUni":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni","status":"modified"},"children":[{"fvTenant":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Villains","status":"deleted"},"children":[]}}]}}
response: {"totalCount":"0","imdata":[]}
```

Now POST the Villains Tenant configuration again; this time you'll see a "200 OK"

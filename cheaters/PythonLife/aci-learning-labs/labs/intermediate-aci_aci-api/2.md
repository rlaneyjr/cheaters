### Expanding the Tree
We started looking at just a Tenant object identifying some of its child classes; now we fill out more of this tree and identify some  build out the same structure with more managed objects.

```json
{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "dn": "uni/tn-Heroes",
            "status": ""
        },
        "children": [
            {

                                }
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },

                        "rn": "ap-Save_The_Planet"
                    },
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "fvAEPg": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "rn": "epg-app"
                                },
                                "children": []
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            "fvAEPg": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "rn": "epg-db"
                                },
                                "children": []
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            "fvAEPg": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "rn": "epg-web"
                                },
                                "children": []
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            {
                "l3extOut": {}
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

We now have a few more pieces of the Tenant portion of the MIT. If you look carefully at the structure of the JSON, you should notice a pattern. Each class has a dictionary of attributes, followed by a list of children. Each child is its own class with its own distinctive set of attributes (e.g. Subnet has unique attributes of `ip` and `scope`) and children. The Subnet class is the exception, and has no children since it is the lowest class in the branch. The Classes and MOs are summarized below:


```
Class fvTenant = Tenant and has a MO of "Heroes"
|
+-- Class fvCtx = VRF and has a MO of "Heroes_Only"
|   |
|   +-- child classes
|
+-- Class fvBD = Bridge Domain and has a MO of "Hero_Land"
|   |
|   +-- Class fvSubnet = Subnet and has MO of "10.1.120.1/22 and "192.168.120.1/22"
|
+-- Class fvAp = Application Profile and has a MO of "Save_The_Planet"
|   |
|   +-- ClassfvAEPg = End Point Group and has MOs of "app", "db", and "web"
|       |
|       +-- child classes
|
+-- Class l3extOut = Layer 3 External Out
    |
    +-- child classes
```

Notice also that the "name" attribute has been removed and the "dn" and "rn" attributes have been used instead. Recall from "ACI Programmability Options" that the Relative Name is the objects name in relation to its class. The Distinguished Name is a universally unique name built by appending an object's RN to its parent's DN. This sounds a bit circular at first, but it works because all DN's are derived from the top-level object, "uni" (similar to how recursive functions work). These names will prove useful when we start to make API requests.

Now that we have a better understanding of Classes and MOs, and how they relate to the MIT, lets look at Visore and make some API requests.

#### Building a Single POST Request
You could modify both requests to create new objects, and use the URLs to individually POST the configurations, but wouldn't it be nice to make only one request? Taking what you have learned about Classes, MOs, and the MIT structure, you'll now do this. First look at the DNs of both Filter and Contract MOs:

*  "uni/tn-Villains/flt-DNS_Query"
*  "uni/tn-Villains/brc-DNS"

Both of these start with `uni/tn-Villains`, so that will be used to create the URL: `https://apic/api/mo/uni/tn-Villains.json`. This also tells us that the beginning of our configuration branch has to be Tenant Villains. Previous Tenant configs can be used formulate this part of the JSON config:
```json
{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "Villains"
        },
        "children": []
    }
}
```

Also looking at the DNs, we know that both the Filter and Contract classes are direct children of the Tenant Class, so it'll be as easy as inserting the configuration data obtained from the Inspector into the Tenant's "children" list. Don't forget that each dictionary is a separate item in the list, so they will need to be separated by a commma.
```json
{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "Villains"
        },
        "children": [
            {
                "vzFilter": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "dn": "uni/tn-Villains/flt-DNS_Query",
                        "name": "DNS_Query",
                        "rn": "flt-DNS_Query",
                        "status": "created"
                    },
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "vzEntry": {
                                "attributes": {

                                },
                                "children": []
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            {
                "vzBrCP": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "dn": "uni/tn-Villains/brc-DNS",

                    },
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "vzSubj": {
                                "attributes": {
                                    "dn": "uni/tn-Villains/brc-DNS/subj-DNS_Query",

                                    "status": "created"
                                },
                                "children": [
                                    {
                                        "vzRsSubjFiltAtt": {
                                            "attributes": {
                                                "status": "created,modified",
                                                "tnVzFilterName": "DNS_Query"
                                            },
                                            "children": []
                                        }
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Instead of deleting the configuration you made in the GUI, add a new Filter for DNS Zone Transfers to the DNS Contract. Here is what needs to be changed in the `vzFilter` (Filter) object

1.  Change the vzFilter "name" to "DNS_ZoneTransfer"
2.  Change the vzEntry "name" to "tcp-53" 
3.  Change the vzEntry "prot" to "tcp"

The `vzBrCP` (Contract) will keep the same name, but will have some other updates:

1.  Change the vzBrCP "status" to "modified" since it has already been "created"
2.  Change the vzSubj "name" to "DNS_ZoneTransfer"
3.  Change the vzRsSubjFiltAtt (the vzFilter being used) "name" to "DNS_ZoneTransfer"

The "dn" and "rn" attributes are not actually required when sending POST requests, so below is a shortened configuration that will work. Also, removing the "dn" and "rn" attributes means there are fewer lines that need changes. If you do not remove these attributes, then they will need to be updated to their new correct values.

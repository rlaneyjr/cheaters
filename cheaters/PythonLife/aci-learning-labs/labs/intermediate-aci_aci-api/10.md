#### Deleting Configurations
Now that you understand how to make GET and POST requests using the API, the final step is to Delete an object. The ACI API actually uses the POST request to delete and object. We noticed similariites to to our creation request when we deleted the Villains Tenant; the difference was the "status" attribute was changed to "deleted" though.

This exercise will have you delete the "DNS" contract. If we take just the DNS Contract portion of the above config, we have this:
```json
{
    "vzBrCP": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "DNS",
            "status": "modified"
        }
    }
}
```

Since you know that `vzBrCP` is a child of `fvTenant`, and that this Contract instance belongs to the Villains Tenant, you'll be able to build the URL:
`https://apic/api/mo/uni/tn-Villains`. Change the "status" attribute to "deleted" and POST the request. 

Since the body only contained the Contract Object, the Filters will still exist on the Fabric.

This module has provided more details on Classes and Managed Objects, and demonstrated how understanding them is important to interacting with the API. We have also explored more of the MIT and shown how it maps to the API by making GET and POST requests. Visore and the API Inspector are tools that make navigating and using the API easier.

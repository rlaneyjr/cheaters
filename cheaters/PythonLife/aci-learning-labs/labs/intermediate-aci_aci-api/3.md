#### Search by DN
Visore can query an object either by Class or by DN. The interface is intelligent enough to determine which method you are using, so there is no need to select the method. First, you will make a DN query for the `app` EPG under the `Save_The_Planet` Application Profile. Looking back at the the previous JSON struture, you can see the the RN is "epg-app." `fvAEPg` objects are children of the `fvAP` class, and this particular `fvAP` object is `ap-Save_The_Planet`. We still haven't made it to root yet, so the next parent object is a `fvTenant` object. This Application's Tenant has a "dn" of `uni/tn-Heroes`. Since `uni` is the root, we can append all of the proper RNs to build the DN: `uni/tn-Heroes/ap-Save_The_Planet/epg-app`. Search for that in your Visore browser.

#### Search by Class
Now browse by Class for fvTenant.

![Visore Class](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/visore_class.png)

Notice this returns all objects of type `fvTenant`, thus returns all 4 tenants configured in the APIC.

Click the "Display URI of last query" link to see the URI used to retrieve the Tenant objects. We will discuss the URI more when we start making the API requests, but this will be very useful. This query returned all Managed Objects of the class fvTenant, however browsing by class also allows for the query to be filtered based on attributes. 

Now run the same query with a filter: `Property: name, Op: ==, Val1: Heroes`.

![Visore Tenant Class Filtered](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_aci-api/assets/images/visore_class_filtered.png)

This returned only the "Heroes" Tenant, and the URI is now double the original path. Take note of the new API call by clicking the Display URI link.

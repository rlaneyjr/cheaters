# Understanding ACI

### NXOS Mode vs. ACI
The Nexus 9000 has two modes of operation to fit different operational models: NXOS mode and Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode. In the NXOS mode of operations, the Nexus 9000 platform utilizes a traditional operating system with enhancements to provide a platform for existing network deployments, while maintaining the capability to leverage next-generation data center protocols and technologies. In NXOS mode, there is the ability for standalone, or device by device level programmability using APIs such Cisco's Nexus NX-API.

With Cisco Nexus 9000 in ACI mode, the infrastructure is centrally managed by a cluster of controllers– the Application Policy Infrastructure Controllers (APICs). ACI is Cisco’s core SDN solution for the data center.  

While NXOS and ACI modes have independent road maps and feature sets, the common hardware platform provides flexibility, choice and value.  The common hardware being referred to is the Nexus platform, specifically the Nexus 9000 series.

### ACI Hardware
On most Nexus 9000 hardware, you can perform a software upgrade to migrate hardware to ACI, an SDN-focused model of operations.

In ACI mode, switches opperate as either a Spine or a Leaf.

*  Spine switches are used to aggregate leaf switches; currently the 93936PQ and 9500 series support spine functionality.
*  Leaf switches are used as access devices; most of the 9300 series switches are designed for this purpose.

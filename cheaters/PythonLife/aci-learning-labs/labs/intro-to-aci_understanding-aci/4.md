#### Tenant Networking
The Tenant Networking objects are similar to network constructs engineers are already familiar with, and provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity between hosts. Tenant Networking consists of: VRFs, Bridge Domains, Subnets, and External Networks.

*  **VRFs**, also named Contexts and Private Networks. This is an isolated routing table for the Tenant. A Tenant can have one or many VRFs, or could use a VRF from the "common" Tenant. In the below diagram, the **infra** VRF is in the grey area. All additional VRFs exist on any leaf that a has a host assigned to the VRF.
*  **Bridge Domains** are the Layer 2 forwarding domain within the fabric, and defines the unique MAC address space and flooding domain (Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast). Each Bridge Domain is associated with only one VRF, however a VRF can be associated with many Bridge Domains. Unlike how VLANs have been traditionally deployed, each Bridge Domain can contain multiple subnets.
*  **Subnets** are the Layer 3 networks that provide IP space and gateway services for hosts to connect to the network. Each subnet is associated with only one Bridge Domain.
*  **External Bridged Networks** connect a Layer 2/Spanning-Tree Network to the ACI fabric. This is commonly used in brownfield environments to have a smooth migration from a traditional network infrastracture to an ACI network. The below diagram also has Layer 2 External networks for L4-L7 devices.
*  **External Routed Networks** create a Layer 3 adjacency with a network outside of the ACI fabric. Layer 3 External networks support adjancies using BGP, OSPF, and EIGRP, or using static routes. Layer 3 connections also have networks defined, which provide and consume contracts (discussed more in Tenant Policy).

### ACI GUI Walkthrough
We have configured a Tenant named "Heroes" in the APIC GUI; go ahead and browse to the APIC and login.

```

```
![APIC Login](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/apic_login.png)

Browse to the "Heroes" Tenant by:

1. Clicking on Tenants
2. Double-clicking on Heroes

![Open Heroes](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/open_heroes_tenant.png)

#### Create Application Profile
You will create a new 2-tier application and use existing contracts to provide and consume services. In the GUI:

1.  Right click on "Application Profiles"
2.  Choose "Create Application Profile."

![Create Application](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/create_application.png)

1.  Name the Application "Power_Up"
2.  Click "SUBMIT"

![Name Application](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/name_application.png)

#### Create Web EPG
Now that the Application is created, you need to configure the "Web" and "DB" EPGs that form this application.

1.  Expand the "Power_Up" directory to get access to the EPGs
2.  Right-click on "Application EPGs"
3.  Choose "Create Application EPG."

![Create EPG](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/create_epg.png)

1.  Name the EPG "Web"
2.  Choose "Heroes/Hero_Land" from the Bridge Domain drop-down
3.  Click "FINISH"

![Create Web](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/create_web.png)

In order to have the Web tier provide a contract you need to:

1.  Expand the Web EPG
2.  Right-click on Contracts
3.  Select "Add Provided Contract."

![Web Provide](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/web_provide.png)

1. Choose "common/web" from the Contract drop-down menu
2. Click "SUBMIT"

![Provide Web](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/provide_web.png)

Consuming a contract follows the same steps, except choose "Add Consumed Contract" this time.

![Web Consume](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/web_consume.png)

1. Choose "common/sql" from the Contract drop-down menu
2. Click "SUBMIT"

![Consume SQL](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/consume_sql.png)

The Web EPG is created, now follow the same steps to create the "DB" EGP.

#### Create DB EPG
Right-click on "Application EPGs" and choose "Create Application EPG."

![Create EPG](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/create_epg.png)

1.  Name the EPG "DB"
2.  Choose "Heroes/Hero_Land" from the Bridge Domain drop-down
3.  Click "FINISH"

![Create DB](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/create_db.png)

Have the DB tier provide the "SQL" contract: 

1.  Expand the DB EPG
2.  Right-click on Contracts
3.  Select "Add Provided Contract."

![DB Provide](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/db_provide.png)

1. Choose "common/sql" from the Contract drop-down menu
2. Click "SUBMIT"

![Provide SQL](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/provide_sql.png)

The DB tier does not consume any services, so the application is now complete with the Web servers able to access the DBs for SQL services. Since we used existing contracts from the "common" Tenant, the necessary resources are also able to consume the Web services from the Web EPG.

It is extremely important to understand Tenant Networking and Tenant Policy before you start programming ACI. Since we've covered these basics, let's now move to looking at the different programability options ACI has to offer.

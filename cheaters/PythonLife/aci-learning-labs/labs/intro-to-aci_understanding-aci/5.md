#### Tenant Policy
The Tenant Policy objects are related to the network objects, but these objects are more focused on the policies and services the endpoints receive. The Tenant Policy consists of: Application Profiles, End Point Groups, Contracts, and Filters. These are all new and ACI specific terms.

*  An **Application Profile** is a container for End Point Groups (EPGs). The Application Profile is used as an identifier for Applications, and allows for separation of adminstrative privileges.
*  An **End Point Group (EPG)** is a collection of endpoints that have the same services and policies applied. EPGs define the switchports, virtual switches, and Layer 2 encapsulations associated with an application service. Each EPG can only be related to one Bridge Domain.
*  **Contracts** define the services and policies applied to the end points in an EPG. Contracts can be used for service redirection to an L4-L7 device, assign QoS values, and to apply ACL rules. The EPG that offers the services **provides** the contract, and the EPGs that need to use the service **consume** the contract.
*  **Filters** are the objects that define protocols (tcp, udp, icmp, etc.) and ports. Filter objects can contain multiple protocols and ports, and Contracts can consume multiple Filters.

Now that you have an understanding of the most common Tenant concepts, let's configure an Application in the APIC GUI.

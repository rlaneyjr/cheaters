### ACI Terminology
It was previously mentioned that the APICs operate using an object-based Policy Engine; this enables the network administrator to define desired states of the fabric, but leave the implementation up to the controller (APIC). As workloads move, the controller re-configures the underlying infrastructure to ensure the necessary policies are still in place for the end hosts. The branch of the object-model these policies are defined under is the **Tenant** object, and this is where most of the day-to-day operations exist.

#### ACI Tenants
Tenants are a top level object that helps identify and separate administrative control, network/failure domains, and application policies. A Tenant's sub-level objects can be grouped into two basic categories: Tenant Networking and Tenant Policy. These two categories do have inherent relationships, but it can be helpful to discuss them separately.

##### Tenant "common"
ACI has a special Tenant named "common" that has unique abilities to easily share its resources with other Tenants. The "common" Tenant is designed to provide shared resources to the entire ACI fabric: things such as DNS, authentication services, security tools, etc. You can also define all of the Tenant Networking objects, Contracts, and Filters in the "common" Tenant and associate these with Applications in other Tenants.

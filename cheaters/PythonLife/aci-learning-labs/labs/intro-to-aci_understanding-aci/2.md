### Diving Deeper into ACI
The Nexus switches running in ACI mode are only programmable via an object-based Policy Engine operating in the APIC controller. The controller is now an integrated part of the network, and holds profiles containing the policies for programming the switches centrally. The switches themselves do not maintain a CLI configuration file as previously used in NXOS based systems.

The configuration is held on the APIC using an object-oriented schema. It is represented with either XML or JSON and stored in a profile to implement application-, network-, and security-driven policies.

#### ACI Components
The core components of an ACI deployment include the following:

*  **Leaf Switches** provide connectivity into the Fabric at the ToR or EoR. They serve as distributed layer 3 gateways, the policy enforcement points, and gateways into external networks. 
*  **Border Leaf Switches** are any leaf nodes that connect to a network device external to the ACI fabric, such as firewalls, load balancers, routers, or non ACI switches(allows a smooth migration to an ACI network).
*  **Spine Switches** provide a non-blocking fabric with rapid failure detection and re-routing. These are used to forward traffic between two leaf switches. Beginning with Software version 2.0(2), ACI supports Layer 3 connections with EVPN to the spine switches.
*  **APIC Controllers** provide the centralized point of management for fabric configuration and observing the summary operational state. From a policy perspective, the APIC is the primary point of contact for configuration and acts as the policy repository.

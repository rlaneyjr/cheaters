#### Subscribing to Multiple Classes
We have created a script that subscribes to both Tenant and Application classes; download the script `acitoolkit_websocket.py` from the sample code repo, or copy this to a file named "acitoolkit_websocket.py"
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from acitoolkit.acitoolkit import *
from credentials import *


def main():
    session = Session(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
    session.login()
    
    subscribe_to_events(session)
    
    
def subscribe_to_events(apic_session):
    Tenant.subscribe(apic_session, only_new=True)
    AppProfile.subscribe(apic_session, only_new=True)

    print("\nListening for Events...\n")
    
    while True:
        if Tenant.has_events(apic_session):
            event = Tenant.get_event(apic_session)
    
            if event.is_deleted():
                status = "has been deleted"
            else:
                status = "has been created/modified"
    
            print("\n{} {}".format(event.dn, status))
    
        elif AppProfile.has_events(apic_session):
            event = AppProfile.get_event(apic_session)
    
            if event.is_deleted():
                status = "has been deleted"
            else:
                status = "has been created/modified"
    
            print("\n{} {}".format(event.dn, status))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```


#### Run the Program
Execute the script in your terminal.
```
$ python acitoolkit_websocket.py

Listening for Events...

```

Your event feed is now subscribed to Tenant and Application level events.

#### Generate Events
First delete the Application you just created, "Example_App"

1.  Right-click on Application "Example_App" and choose Delete
2.  Click YES

![GUI Delete App](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_websockets/assets/images/gui_delete_app.png)

Look back at the terminal window and you will see a new notification for App deletion.
```
$ python acitoolkit_websocket.py

Listening for Events...

uni/tn-WS_Example/ap-Example_App has been deleted

```

Now delete the Tenant, "WS_Example"

1.  Right-click on Tenant "WS_Example" and choose Delete
2.  Click YES

![GUI Delete Tenant](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_websockets/assets/images/gui_delete_tenant.png)

Look back at the terminal and you will now see a message for the Tenant deletion.
```
$ python acitoolkit_websocket.py

Listening for Events...

uni/tn-WS_Example/Example_App has been deleted

uni.tn-WS_Example has been deleted

```

This lab has introduced the topic of websockets, and how they can be used to subscribe to events in the ACI fabric. We also demonstrated how ACI Toolkit simplifies this process, and how to leverage Python to automatically send notifications when they are recieved. This functionality can be used with a web framework to create an event dashboard that is used to monitor and classify important events.

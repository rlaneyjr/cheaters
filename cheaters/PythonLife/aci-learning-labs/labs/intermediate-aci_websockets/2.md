### Simple Web Socket Client
We said that we will use the Simple Websocket Client to open a websocket connection, and recieve messages from the server. This client does not provide a method to login to the APIC or to subscribe to the an event feed, so we will leverage Postman for these tasks.

#### Establish a session and retrieve the token
The first two steps outlined for using websockets with ACI is to connect to the APIC and retrieve the token. The token is sent back in the APIC's response upon a successful login.

Go ahead and open Postman and establish a session with the APIC.
```
Method: POST
URL: https://198.18.133.200/api/aaaLogin.json
Body: {"aaaUser": {"attributes": {"name": "admin","pwd": "C1sco12345"}}}
```

The token is returned in the response body as "token"

#### Use the token to open a websocket
This token is then used to open a websocket using the following URL:
```
wss://198.18.133.200/socket%TOKEN%
```
Example:
```
TOKEN = yH3iaibhGTqn11FzBV5acvDYKyqm3bLm/jZg3aFASPXZPoSIwWCiqV1NITdqnluIwtEeu0ast5/j7NeJqnryAQnCIuL9VEFppab40a9EZkyd92uvXaX3v2ikYwOZgy9Yp9U1Xc3KDk/+6cP+299OxoUkA9sG4w4z24nIz73JwE4=
URL = wss://apic/socketyH3iaibhGTqn11FzBV5acvDYKyqm3bLm/jZg3aFASPXZPoSIwWCiqV1NITdqnluIwtEeu0ast5/j7NeJqnryAQnCIuL9VEFppab40a9EZkyd92uvXaX3v2ikYwOZgy9Yp9U1Xc3KDk/+6cP+299OxoUkA9sG4w4z24nIz73JwE4=
```

Open a wss connection using Chrome's Simple Web Socket Client with your token.

If you get a pop-up, then your login was unsuccessful; get a fresh token with Postman and try again.

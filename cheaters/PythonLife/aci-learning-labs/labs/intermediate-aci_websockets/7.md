### Automating Event Notifications
It would be better if we could automatically check for events and print them to the screen when new events are pushed from the APIC. With Python, we can do this with an infinite "while loop" and use a truthiness test for the `has_events()` function. In python, "while True:" will always be true, and can be used to create an infinite loop. Inside the loop we check for an event, and then use the `is_deleted()` function to test whether the object is deleted, or created/modified.

#### Create a Loop
Create an infinite loop checking for events for the Class Subscription:
```python
>>> while True:
...     if Tenant.has_events(session):
...         event = Tenant.get_event(session)
...         if event.is_deleted():
...             status = "has been deleted"
...         else:
...             status = "has been created/modified"
...         print("\n{} {}".format(event.dn, status))
...

```

#### Cause an Event to be Generated
Now that you are listening to an event feed, go into the APIC GUI and create a new Tenant named "WS_Example" by:

1.  Click on Tenants tab
2.  Click on "ADD Tenant"
3.  Enter "WS_Example" for the Name
4.  Click Submit

![GUI Add Tenant](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_websockets/assets/images/gui_add_tenant.png)

Look back at your Python Interpreter window and you will see a new message.
```bash
...

uni/tn-WS_Example has been created/modified

uni/tn-WS_Example has been created/modified

```

#### Create an Application
Now create an Application under Tenant WS_Example called "Example_App"

1.  Right-click on Application Profiles and choose "Create Application Profile"

![GUI Add App1](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_websockets/assets/images/gui_add_app1.png)

2.  Enter "Example_App" for the Name
3.  Click Submit

![GUI Add App2](/posts/files/intermediate-aci_websockets/assets/images/gui_add_app2.png)

Your event feed will still look the same since we are only checking for events in the Tenant class.
```python

uni/tn-WS_Example has been created/modified

uni/tn-WS_Example has been created/modified

```

#### Subscribing to events
With the websocket open, subscriptions are established using GET requests to the Class or MO URL followed by **subscription=yes**. 

Use Postman to subscribe to events on the Heroes Tenant:

```
HTTP Method: GET
URL: https://198.18.133.200/api/mo/uni/tn-Heroes.json?subscription=yes
```

>Since websockets allow for multiple communication channels over a single TCP session, you can subscribe to multiple Classes and managed objects using the same websocket session.

#### Recieve an Event
Now you need to generate an event for the Heroes Tenant so you can see the message in your Simple Web Socket Client. You can do this by giving the Tenant a description:

1. Click on Tenants
2. Open the Heroes Tenant
3. Click on Policy
4. Type Echo in the Description box
5. Click SUBMIT

Look back at your websocket client now for the event message.

The first item in the websocket message is the the **subscription ID**, which will match the what you recieved back in Postman. Subscription IDs are unique for every event feed that has a subscription. This allows you to identify and classify events coming into your application, and is also used to refresh subscriptions before they timeout. The rest of the message identifies what caused the message to be generated.

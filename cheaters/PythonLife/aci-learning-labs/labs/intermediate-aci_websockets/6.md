#### Creating an Event
Since you subscribed to only new events, you must first make a change to the Heroes Tenant before an event will be generated. Like you did with the Simple Web Socket Client, we have you update the "Description" field. You can do this with your existing ACI Toolkit session:
```python
>>> heroes_tenant = Tenant("Heroes")
>>> heroes_tenant.descr = "Echo Echo"
>>> session.push_to_apic(heroes_tenant.get_url(), data=heroes_tenant.get_json())
<Response [200]>
>>> 
```

#### Viewing Websocket Events
The Toolkit uses the `Class.has_events(session)` function to check if there are any events in the queue, and the `Class.get_event(session)` to retrieve the first event in the queue.

Check for events and view the first event:
```python
>>> Tenant.has_events(session)
True
>>> event = Tenant.get_event(session)
>>> print(event)
Heroes
>>> print(event.dn)
uni/tn-Heroes
>>> event.is_deleted()
False
```

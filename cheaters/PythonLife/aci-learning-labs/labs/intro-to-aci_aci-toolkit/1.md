# ACI Programmability to Go - ACI Toolkit
Since you already have a high level understanding of the ACI Toolkit, we are now going to do a deeper dive into what it offers by reviewing it's core features and functionality. ACI Toolkit comes with 3 primary tools to interact with ACI:

* A Set of sample scripts
* A lightweight Python library
* Several pre-built applications using the toolkit library

First, we are going to provide an introduction to each one of them, and then we provide some hands-on examples for you to go through.
>There is no need to follow along with the examples on this page. You will begin using the ACI Toolkit features starting on the next page.

### Sample Scripts
The Toolkit comes with over 40 sample scripts that are ready to be used. These scripts accomplish varying GET, POST, and DELETE tasks, and might require specific arguments depending on the task it performs. Here we show an example of a sample script that prints all tenants and their health.
```bash
$ python acitoolkit/samples/aci-show-tenant-health.py 
APIC login username: admin
APIC URL: https://apic
APIC Password: 
tenant                                                                 current_health  
---------                                                              ----    
common                                                                 100     
infra                                                                  100     
Heroes                                                                 95      
mgmt                                                                   100 
$ 
```

### Toolkit Library
As mentioned in the Programmability Options lab, ACI Toolkit is not a full featured library like Cobra. Instead, it seeks to provide easy access to programming the most common tasks when managing an ACI fabric. The toolkit provides a friendlier Python library by creating more familiar object names to someone who has spent just a little bit of time in the APIC GUI. For instance, the API references a tenant by "fv.Tenant", whereas the ACI Toolkit simply uses "Tenant." Here we show an example of viewing all Tenants configured on the APIC:
```python
>>> from acitoolkit.acitoolkit import *
>>> from credentials import *
>>> 
>>> session = Session(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
>>> session.login()
<Response [200]>
>>> 
>>> tenant_list = Tenant.get(session)
>>> for tenant in tenant_list:
...     print(tenant)
... 
common
infra
mgmt
Heroes
>>> 
```

### Toolkit Applications
There are several applications that are installed with the Toolkit package. These are more robust then the sample scripts, and often have visual representations instead of just displaying info back to a terminal window. Since these do have more features, they sometimes require additional applications to be installed, such as Flask or MySQL. Some applications are used for historical purposes and should be installed on a server and left running; an example would be endpoint tracker, which keeps record of where and when hosts join and leave the fabric. One of the applications, "object_browser," allows you to browse Managed Objects by either Class or the DN of a Managed Object. This application also returns the data with hyperlinks to make browsing through an object's relationships more convenient.

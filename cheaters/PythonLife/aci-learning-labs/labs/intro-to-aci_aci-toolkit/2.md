### Using Sample Scripts
Using the pre-built scripts that come with ACI Toolkit is an easy way to get familiar with its capabliites. This lab will have you run a couple of "show command" scripts to get you familiar with what is available. Before you begin, here are a few arguments that you should be aware of:

*  `-h` will display the help menu with all acceptable arguments/parameters.
*  `-u` is for passing in the URL
*  `-l` passes in the username
*  `-p` passes in the password

The login arguments can also be left out and the script will prompt for the information.

#### Browse to the acitoolkit samples directory
In order to run the pre-defined sample scripts, you will need to be in the acitoolkit/samples directory. Most of these can be ran by simply by typing `python name-of-file.py` and entering the APIC login information.

Go ahead and browse to the samples directory:
```bash
$ cd directory/path/to/acitoolkit/samples
$ pwd
/home/user/acitoolkit/acitoolkit/samples
$ 
```

#### Run the Show EPGs sample script
The Show EPGs script displays the Tenant and App Profile for each EPG created in the ACI fabric. Execute the program and enter your authentication credentials.
```bash
$ python aci-show-epgs.py
APIC login username: admin
APIC URL: https://198.18.133.200
APIC Password: C1sco12345
TENANT              APP_PROFILE          EPG            
------              -----------          ---            
infra               access               default        
Heroes              Save_The_Planet      app            
Heroes              Save_The_Planet      web            
Heroes              Save_The_Planet      db   
```

#### Run the Show Endpoints sample script
The Show Endpoints script displays information about all hosts connected to the ACI fabric. Execute this script with the authentication parameters using the `-l`, `-u`, and `-p` flags.
```bash
$ python aci-show-endpoints.py -l admin -u https://198.18.133.200 -p C1sco12345
MACADDRESS         IPADDRESS     INTERFACE     ENCAP     TENANT    APP PROFILE      EPG
-----------------  ------------  ------------  --------  --------  ---------------  -----
43:CD:BB:C0:00:00  2222::66:1    Heroes_FI-2B  vlan-202  Heroes    Save_The_Planet  db
44:CD:BB:C0:00:00  10.193.102.2  Heroes_FI-2B  vlan-202  Heroes    Save_The_Planet  db
43:CD:BB:C0:00:00  2222::66:1    Heroes_FI-2B  vlan-200  Heroes    Save_The_Planet  web
44:CD:BB:C0:00:00  10.193.102.2  Heroes_FI-2A  vlan-200  Heroes    Save_The_Planet  web
```

These sample scripts are just pre-built programs using the ACI Toolkit library. Now that you have been introduced to the Toolkit, let's take a look at the python library.

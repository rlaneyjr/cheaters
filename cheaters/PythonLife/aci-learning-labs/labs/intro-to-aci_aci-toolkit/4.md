### Using Toolkit Applications
We have chosen to demonstrate the Diagrams application, but there are many more that exist within the Toolkit such as a Lint application, Endpoint Tracker, RSS Teader, Cable Plan Validation, and Visualizations.

#### Diagram
The Diagram application will generate a diagram of the Tenant objects and their children for an easy to consume image of their relationships. This application does require graphviz to be installed before it will be able to draw the diagram. By default, the application will draw all Tenants, but the `-t` argument can be used to pass a single Tenant, or a list of desired Tenants.

##### Browse to the ACI Diagram Directory
Browse to the aci-diagram directory:
```bash
$ cd directory/path/before/toolkit/acitoolkit/applications/aci-diagram
$ 
```
You should see the following files in the directory
```bash
$ ls
diagram.py   README.md
$
```

##### Run the Diagram Program 
The EPGs inside of our Heroes Tenant use Contracts from the common Tenant, so in order to include that in the diagram, you will need to pass both Tenants to the program. Use the `-o` flag to save the file as heroes.png:
```bash
$ python diagram.py -o heroes.png -t Heroes common
APIC login username: admin
APIC URL: https://apic
APIC Password:
Processing tenant common
Processing tenant Heroes


Drawing graph to heroes.png
$ 
```

Now open the heroes.png file and you should see the below image.

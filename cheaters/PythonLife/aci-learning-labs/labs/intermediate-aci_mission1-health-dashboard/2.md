### Dashboard Application
The sample code repo has a directory named **dashboard**. Inside that directory is a Flask application for monitoring the health of all Applications under the SnV Tenant. Copy this directory to your local machine.

### Correcting views.py
Once you have copied the dashboard directory, open up the **app** sub-directory. Inside this directory is a file named **views.py**. This file contains the functions used to collect the list of Applications, their current Health Score, and any Faults associated with an Application. A few of the lines have a **SET ME** that you will need to replace with the correct code; we have also provided a few hints below the code block.
>The "Cobra" lab includes a discussion on making and scoping queries in Cobra, and the "ACI API" lab discusses more details on the Scoping Filter options.

#### get_healthscore() Function
Here are the lines that need updating with a hint:

1.  app_query.queryTarget = SET ME _(Should be set to return child objects only)_
2.  app_query.classFilter = SET ME _(Should be the class name used by the API to identify an Application Profile)_
3.  app_query.subtreeInclude = SET ME _(Should be the string used to include Health Scores)_
4.  apps = SET ME _(Should be the function used to query the APIC for the app_query object)_

#### get_faults() Function
Here are the lines that need updating with a hint:

1.  fault_query.queryTarget = SET ME _(Should be set to return the Managed Object and its children)_
2.  fault_query.subtreeInclude = SET ME _(Should be the string used to include Faults)_
3.  faults = SET ME _(Should be the function used to query the APIC for the fault_query object)_

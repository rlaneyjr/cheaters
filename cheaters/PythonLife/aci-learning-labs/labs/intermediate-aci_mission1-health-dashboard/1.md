# Mission: Create an Application Health Dashboard
As Superheroes and Villains continues to grow, there is increasing demand to quickly isolate and resolve incidents. Since they have deployed ACI in their new datacenter, your boss has decided to leverage its programming capablities to meet these requirements.

You have been asked to create an Application Health Dashboard that displays SnV's applications with their Health Score. You decide to use ACI's Cobra package to query the fabric and report the health for all of SnVs applications, and also report any faults when the application clicked.

### Mission Setup
Before starting the mission, execute the `create_snv_apps.py` file in the sample code repo. This will create the SnV Tenant with 4 Applications and assigns network resources.

#### Credentials File
We use a `credentials.py` file in this lab to authenticate with the APIC. If you are following along with your own device, then we suggest creating this file and saving it in your working directory. The file should look like this with updated parameters for your environment:
```
URL = 'https://198.18.133.200'
LOGIN = 'admin'
PASSWORD = 'C1sco12345'
```

We have also provided this file with the our Dashboard Application in the sample code repo.

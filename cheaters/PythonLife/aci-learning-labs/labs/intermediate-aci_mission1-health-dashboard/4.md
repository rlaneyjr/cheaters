### View the Dashboard
Now that you have a working views.py file, go ahead and take a look at the dashboard. First, start the application by executing the `run.py` file in the dashboard directory.
```bash
$ pwd
/home/user/dashboard
$ ls
app  data  flask  requirements.txt  run.py
$ python run.py
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger pin code: 102-464-421
```

The dashboard uses port 5000, so open your browser to http://localhost:5000 to view the Application Health Dashboard.

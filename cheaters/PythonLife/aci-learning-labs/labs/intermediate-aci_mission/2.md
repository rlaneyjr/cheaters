### Application Health Score Solution
```python
def get_app_health():
    # login to the apic
    auth = cobra.mit.session.LoginSession('https://apic', 'admin', 'password')
    session = cobra.mit.access.MoDirectory(auth)
    session.login()

    # query the apic for snv's applications and their health scores
    app_query = cobra.mit.request.DnQuery('uni/tn-SnV')
    app_query.queryTarget = 'children'
    app_query.classFilter = 'fvAp'
    app_query.subtreeInclude = 'health'
    apps = session.query(app_query)

    # build a dictionary from query results
    health_dict = {}
    for app in apps:
        for health in app.children:
            health_dict[app.name] = int(health.cur)

    return health_dict

```

### Collecting Faults
Now that you have the Health Scores, the next step is to get an Application's Faults. The dashboard can determine the correct Application name based on the Application that is clicked; your function needs to build the DnQuery from this name. Setting the rsp-subtree-include to "faults,no-scoped" returns the faults associated with the DnQuery. Use one of the apps returned from the "app_query" response on the previous page to test with.
```python
>>> print(apps[0].dn))
uni/tn-SnV/ap-Rescue
>>> app = "Rescue"
>>> fault_query = cobra.mit.request.DnQuery("uni/tn-SnV/ap-{}".format(app))
>>> fault_query.queryTarget = "subtree"
>>> fault_query.subtreeInclude = "faults,no-scoped"
```

#### Sorting and Paginating Results
The API provides mechanisms to sort and paginate the returned results. Paging allows for two options:

*  How many results to display per page
*  Return only a specific page from the results (0 is the first page)

Ordering the results is done by adding `classname.property[|{asc | desc}]` to the request URI. ACI defaults to sorting in ascending (asc) order, so you must supply `|desc` for descending order. Cobra sorts the results by setting the `orderBy` property equal to the sorting string portion of the URI.

The `pageSize` and `page` properties are used to specify how many results to return per page, and what page to return. For this dashboard: sort the fault results by severity, return 15 results per page, and only return the first page.
```python
>>> fault_query.orderBy = "faultInfo.severity|desc"
>>> fault_query.page = 0
>>> fault_query.pageSize = 15
>>> fault_query.options
'page-size=15&rsp-subtree-include=faults,no-scoped&order-by=faultInfo.severity|desc&query-target=subtree&page=0'
>>> 
```

#### Viewing Faults
Faults have several helpful properties used to determine:

* What the issue is
* When the issue started
* What is the current state

We have provided a for loop to print a few of the more useful properties here:
```python 
>>> faults = session.query(fault_query)
>>> for fault in faults:
...     if fault.lc == "retaining":
...         print("Acknowledged: {}".format(fault.ack))
...         print("Affected: Issue No Longer Exists")
...         print("Description: {}".format(fault.descr))
...         print("Time: {}".format(fault.created))
...         print("Life Cycle: {}".format(fault.lc))
...     else:
...         print("Acknowledged: {}".format(fault.ack))
...         print("Affected: {}".format(fault.affected))
...         print("Description: {}".format(fault.descr))
...         print("Time: {}".format(fault.created))
...         print("Life Cycle: {}".format(fault.lc))
... 
Acknowledged: no
Affected: topology/pod-1/node-101/local/svc-policyelem-id-0/uni/epp/fv-[uni/tn-SnV/ap-Rescue/epg-Web]/node-101/stpathatt-[eth1/10]/nwissues
Description: Configuration failed for uni/tn-SnV/ap-Evolution_X/epg-Database node 101 eth1/10 due to Invalid VLAN Configuration
Time: 2017-03-09T17:54:48.470+00:00
Life Cycle: raised
>>> 
```

Note that we need to check if the fault's life cycle is in a retaining state before accessing the `affected` attribute. A life cycle of "retaining" means the issue has recently cleared, so there is no longer an affected object. A fault that is not affecting anything will not have the `affected` property, and therefore raises an Exception when trying to access it.

#### Create Fault Collection Function
Now that we have walked you through scoping the DnQuery for faults, create a function that takes an application name and returns the Application's fault information as a list of dictionaries; the list should be stored in a dictionary with a key named "faults." The solution is provided on the following page.

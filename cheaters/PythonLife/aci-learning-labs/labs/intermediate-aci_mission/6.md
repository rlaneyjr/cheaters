### Push Websocket Notifications to Spark
Now that you know how to send messages to Spark with Python, you are ready to  add this functionality to the script used in the "ACI Websockets" lab. This script is also provided here:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from acitoolkit.acitoolkit import *

main():
    URL = "https://apic"
    LOGIN = "admin"
    PASSWORD = "password"

    session = Session(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
    session.login()

    subscribe_to_events()

def subsribe_to_events():
    Tenant.subscribe(session)
    AppProfile.subscribe(session)

    while True:
        if Tenant.has_events(session)
            event = Tenant.get_event(session)

            if event.is_deleted():
                status = "has been deleted"
            else:
                status = "has been created/modified"

            print("\n{} {}".format(event.dn, status))

        elif AppProfile.has_events(session):
            event = AppProfile.get_event(session)

            if event.is_deleted():
                status = "has been deleted"
            else:
                status = "has been created/modified"

            print("\n{} {}".format(event.dn, status))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

#### Adding Argparse
The above script doesn't require any input from the terminal, however the access token to authenticate with Spark will vary on login. In order to account for this, use the argparse library to handle arguments passed in from the terminal.
```python
import argparse

cli_args = argparse.ArgumentParser("Post to Spark", "Collects an Access Token to connect to Spark Chatroom")
cli_args.add_argument('-t', '--token', required=True,
                      help="The Access Token provided by https://developer.ciscospark.com/ after login.")

args = cli_args.parse_args()

TOKEN = "Bearer {}".format(vars(args)["token"])
```

#### Mission Task
You need to accomplish the following in order to complete the mission:

1.  Add a new subscription for the EPG class
2.  Create a new function, `post_message_to_spark`, to handle pushing notifications to the SnV NOC chatroom
3.  Instead of printing subscription events to the terminal, have the script call the `post_message_to_spark` function.

>TIP: The token variable is handled by argparse, and made a global variable. This means the only variable data that needs to be handled by the post_message_to_spark is the message being delivered.

The Solution is provided in the sample code repo as "push_notifications_to_spark.py", as well as on the following page.

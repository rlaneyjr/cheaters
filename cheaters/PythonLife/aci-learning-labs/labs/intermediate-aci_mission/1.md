# Mission: Create an Application Health Dashboard
As Superheroes and Villains continues to grow, there is increasing demand to quickly isolate and resolve incidents. Since they have deployed ACI in their new datacenter, your boss has decided to leverage its programming capablities to meet these requirements.

You have been asked to create an Application Health Dashboard that displays SnV's applications with their Health Score. You decide to use ACI's Cobra package to query the fabric and report the health for all of SnVs applications, and also report any faults when the application clicked.

### Mission Setup
Before starting the mission, execute the create_snv_apps.py file in the sample code repo. This will create the SnV Tenant with 4 Applications and assigns network resources.

### Collecting Health Scores
In order to build a dashboard for Application Health, you first need to determine the correct query string to use. Since your boss is only concerned with Applications residing under the SnV Tenant, you will use a DnQuery and add scoping filters. Go ahead and establish a session with the APIC and create a DnQuery object for the SnV Tenant.
```bash
$ python
>>> 
```
```python
>>> import cobra.mit.access
>>> import cobra.mit.request
>>> import cobra.mit.session
>>> 
>>> auth = cobra.mit.session.LoginSession("https://apic", "admin", "password")
>>> session = cobra.mit.access.MoDirectory(auth)
>>> session.login()

>>> 
>>> app_query = cobra.mit.request.DnQuery("uni/tn-SnV")
>>> 
```

#### Add Scoping Filters
The Application class is a child object of the Tenant class, so the query-target needs to include "children"; however, the Tenant class has other child classes besides Application, so you need to set the target-subtree-class to "fvAp." In order to obtain the Health Score, the rsp-subtree-include should be set to "health." If you would like to try this on your own, the Intermediate Cobra lab lists several scoping filters and their corresponding API formats. The solution is listed below:
```python
>>> app_query.queryTarget = "children"
>>> app_query.classFilter = "fvAp"
>>> app_query.subtreeInclude = "health"
>>> 
>>> app_query.options
'target-subtree-class=fvAp&rsp-subtree-include=health&query-target=children'
>>> apps = session.query(app_query)
>>> for app in apps:
...     print(app.name)
...

```

#### Accessing Health Scores
The `subtreeInclude` response values are stored as "children" of the returned objects. The children objects are an Iterator Class in Python, which means that the children must be accessed by iterating through the object. You can create an empty list, and append the child objects to the list as you iterate through them. Once you have a health score object, you can use `dir(object)` to view the available attributes. You only need one application object, so use the first application in the returned application list.
```python
>>> app_children = []
>>> for child in apps[0].children:
...     app_children.append(child)
... 
>>> app_children
[<cobra.modelimpl.health.inst.Inst object at 0x7fcd73e099d0>]
>>> dir(app_children[0])
['_BaseMo__children', '_BaseMo__dirtyProps', '_BaseMo__dn', '_BaseMo__meta', '_BaseMo__modifyChild',
'_BaseMo__parentDn', '_BaseMo__parentMo','_BaseMo__rn', '_BaseMo__setModified', '_BaseMo__setprop',
'_BaseMo__status', '_ChildContainer', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__doc__', '__format__',

'_parentDn', '_resetProps', '_rn', '_setParent', '_status', 'childAction', 'children', 'chng', 'clone',
'contextRoot', 'cur', 'delete', 'dirtyProps', 'dn', 'isInstance', 'isPropDirty', 'maxSev', 'meta', 'numChildren',
'parent', 'parentDn', 'prev', 'prop', 'resetProps', 'rn', 'status', 'twScore', 'updTs', 'update']
>>> 
```

#### Viewing Health Scores
A few of Health Score properties are interesting, but the **cur** value will return the current health of the Application. Iterate over each Application in Tenant SnV and print its name and current Health Score.
```python
>>> apps = session.query(app_query)
>>> for app in apps:
...     for health in app.children:
...         print("{}\nCurrent: {}\n".format(app.name, health.cur))
... 
Rescue
Current: 95

Chaos
Current: 95

Power_Up
Current: 95

Evolution_X
Current: 95

>>> 
```

#### Create Health Score Function
Now that you know how to report a Tenant's Application Health, it is time to turn these steps into a function that will be used to update the dashboard. Your dashboard front end needs the function to return a dictionary with the Application names as keys, and their Health Scores as key values. The solution is provided on the next page.

### Use Spark's API
In order to use websockets to push notifications to Spark, you first need to create the new room, and learn how post new messages using its API. The first step to using Spark's API is authenticating requests, which is done with an **Access Token**. The access token can be retrieved from https://developer.ciscospark.com.

#### Copy Access Token
Once you are logged into the developer page, the token can be copied by clicking on your profile image on the upper right corner of the page.

#### Create a New Room
You need this access token to create a new room using python and the `requests` module. The token should have `Bearer ` attached to the front of the token's value. Go ahead and open a Python Interpreter, import the requests module, and save the token as a string to a variable named "access_token."
```bash
$ python
```
```python
>>> import requests
>>> access_token = "Bearer NDAxTOWEOGMtOTA2OWQ0OWI2ZmQ0ZmQtZmE4ZS00YTBjLROTM5ZDUxOTktOWE5wi"
>>> 
```

##### Build the Request
The API request to create a new room will use the POST method, and needs to provide the URL, Headers, and Body.

*  The URL used to interact with the Spark Room API is:
```
https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/rooms
```

*  The headers need to specify the "Content-Type" and "Authorization" information; Spark uses application/json and the access token respectively.

```json
{
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer NDAxTOWEOGMtOTA2OWQ0OWI2ZmQ0ZmQtZmE4ZS00YTBjLROTM5ZDUxOTktOWE5wi"
}
```

*  The Body is the data used to create the new room, which will be in JSON format. Creating a room is done by passing a key/value pair of "title" and the name of the new room.
```json
{
    "title": "SnV NOC"
}
```

Create the `room_url`, `header`, and `room_body` variables with these values in the Python Interpreter.
```python
>>> room_url = "https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/rooms"
>>> header = {"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": access_token}
>>> room_body = {"title": "SnV NOC"}
>>> 
```

##### Create the SnV NOC Room
Using the requests module, make a POST request and pass in the url, header, and body. Printing the response's `status_code` and `reason` confirms the request was successful.
```python
>>> room_response = requests.post(room_url, json=room_body, headers=header)
>>> print("{}: {}".format(room_response.status_code, room_response.reason))
200: OK
>>> 
```

Look at your Spark message page and verify the SnV NOC room exists.

#### Post a Message to SnV NOC
In order to post a message to the SnV NOC room via the API, you need to know the Room ID. This information is returned as part of the request's response content. Once you have the ID, the new API request will be similar to creating a new room.

##### Retrieve the Room ID
The response content is returned as a string, so you first need to transform the content into a JSON dictionary using the json library. The dictionary key for the Room ID is "id."
```python
>>> room_response.content
'{"id":"Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL1JPT00vYTA3NTA0MTAtMDM4MC0xMWU3LWE1MzAtNmY2YjY2ZDJhMjg4","title":"SnV NOC","type":"group","isLocked":false,"lastActivity":"2017-03-07T21:54:24.099Z","creatorId":"Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL1BFT1BMRS9lNGUwMGRjYy05MzkwLTRlNDYtYjIxNi1kYjg2Y2E2NDgzZTc","created":"2017-03-07T21:54:24.081Z"}'
>>> 
>>> import json
>>> room_response_content = json.loads(room_response.content)
>>> room_id = room_response_content["id"]
>>> room_id
u'Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL1JPT00vYTA3NTA0MTAtMDM4MC0xMWU3LWE1MzAtNmY2YjY2ZDJhMjg4'
>>> 
```

##### Build the Request
The request to post a message to a chat room will use the same headers, but the URL and request Body need to be updated.

*  The URL to interact with the message API is:
```
https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/messages
```

*  The body of the request is two key/value pairs:
    -  "text" and message contents
    -  "roomId" and the Room ID.
```json
{
    "text": "This message is from Python",
    "roomId": "Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL1JPT00vYTA3NTA0MTAtMDM4MC0xMWU3LWE1MzAtNmY2YjY2ZDJhMjg4"
}
```

Go ahead and make new variables, `message_url` and `message_body`, with the appropriate values. Post the message to the chat room.
```python
>>> message_url = "https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/messages"
>>> message_body = {"text": "This message is from Python", "roomId": room_id}
>>> message_response = requests.post(message_url, json=message_body, headers=header)
>>> print("{}: {}".format(response.status_code, response.reason))
200: OK
>>> 
```

Look back at your SnV NOC chatroom and verify the message was posted.

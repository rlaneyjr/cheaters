# Mission: Troubleshoot Application Reachability

### Evolution X Web Problems
The Evolution X application team was impressed with how fast you were able to them with network resources, but they report that there is an issue with accessing their web servers. All of the other tiers seem to be working fine. Your objective is to use the tools in ACIToolkit to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

### ACIToolkit
The Toolkit provides 3 main tools for interacting with ACI: A Python Library, pre-built scripts, and programs that give reports and visuals. This mission will use all 3 to troubleshoot and resolve the issue Evolution X is experiencing.

### Visualizing the Evolution X Application

#### Graphing with Diagrams
The ACIToolkit repository comes with several applications that can be helpful to diagnose potential issues in ACI. The first application that might be handy in this instance is the aci-diagram application. Browse to the aci-diagram directory
```bash
$ cd /path/to/toolkit/applications/aci-diagram
$ls
diagram.py  README.md
$ 
```

You will just need to diagram the SnV Tenant since all configurations for Evolution X reside inside this Tenant.
```bash
$ diagram.py -t SnV -o snv.png
APIC login username: admin
APIC URL: https://apic
APIC Password:
Processing tenant SnV


Drawing graph to snv.png
$ 
```

Open the diagram to view the high level relationships of the Objects in SnV. Look at the EPG to Bridge Domain relationships and you should notice that one of the EPGs is slightly different than the other six.

#### Using Lint to Troubleshoot
Another application that would be good to use when troubleshooting and issue is Lint. This tool will examine the configuration and report back anything that looks to be incorrect. From the aci-diagram directory, you can navigate to the lint directory by going back one step and into lint
```bash
$ cd ../lint
$ ls
acilint.py  lint.html  README.md
$ 
```

You can use the -o flag to generate an html file, which makes the data easier to read.
```bash
$ python acilint.py -o evolution.html
APIC URL: https://apic
APIC Password:
Creating file evolution.html
Getting configuration from APIC....
Processing configuration....
$ 
```
When you open the file, you should notice an orange block that highlights an error indicating the same issue you noticed using the Diagram tool. The message says that the Web-UI EPG is not associated with a Bridge Domain. Recall that the Bridge Domain is the flooding domain and determines what subnets are available for hosts connected to the EPG. This would definitely explain why Evolution X is not able to access their web servers.

### Connecting Web-UI to a Bridge Domain

#### Programming with ACIToolkit
You can use the acitoolkit library to attach the EPG to the correct Bridge Domain. You can start by entering a python session and importing the acitoolkit library. A sample credentials file is saved in the sample code repo.
```python
$ python
>>> from credentials import *
>>> from acitoolkit.acitoolkit import *
>>> 
```

Here is where you need to know the tree from the top level object to the EPG. You might recall that the the Tenant object is the top level object for Applications. Lets create a session start there.
```python
>>> tenant = Tenant("SnV")
>>> 
```

You may or may not remember the rest of the tree, so if you forgot, the below illustration shows the Application Object is a child of Tenant and the Parent of EPGs.

![ACIToolkit Object Model](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_mission/assets/images/acitoolkit_object_model.png)

Go ahead and work down the tree to create an object representing the "Web-UI" EPG.
```python
>>> app = AppProfile("Evolution_X", tenant)
>>> epg = EPG("Web-UI", app)
>>> 
```

The next thing you need to recall is what Bridge Domain to associate with "Web-UI", and how to assign a Bridge Domain to this EPG. If you look back to the original JSON or Python configuration files, you should see that "antigravity" was created for the Bridge Domain inside of the SnV Tenant. The method used to associate an EPG with a Bridge Domain is to use the "add_bd" function on th EPG object.
```python
>>> bd = BridgeDomain('antigravity', tenant)
>>> epg.add_bd(bd)
>>> 
```

This completes the configurartion, once it is submitted the error with "Web-UI" should be resolved.
```python
>>> sess = Session(URL, USERNAME, PASSWORD)
>>> sess.login()
>>> resp = sess.push_to_apic(tenant.get_url(), data=tenant.get_json())
>>> print(resp.status_code)
>>> 200
>>> exit()
$ 
```

A status code of 200 means the configuration was succusfully added to the EPG. It is time to have Evolution X retest their application. You can re-run the diagrams and lint applications to confirm.

### More Troubleshooting with ACIToolkit

#### Using a Few Sample Scripts
The Evolution X app team has tested their application again, and report that the web servers are now reachable, but not on tcp/8080 and tcp/8443 as they requested. You can use some sample scripts to help diagnose the issue.

First navigate to the samples directory and execute the show contracts file.
```bash
$ cd path/to/toolkit/samples
$ python aci-show-contracts.py
APIC login username: admin
APIC URL: https://1.2.3.4
APIC Password: 
Tenant              Contract            
------              --------            
common              default             
common              web                 
common              power_up            
common              sql                 
SnV                 web-ui                
SnV                 object-store 
SnV                 api-gateway                
SnV                 logging
SnV                 message-broker 
SnV                 user-data                
SnV                 analytics
$ 
```

It looks like all of the contracts were created, but perhaps the web-ui contract has the wrong filters. Try running the show all filter entries script for the SnV Tenant to see what entries have been created.
```bash
$ python aci-show-all-filter-entries.py -t SnV
APIC login username: admin
APIC URL: https://apic
APIC Password: 
Tenant Filter Entry  
------ ------ -------
SnV    http   tcp-80 
SnV    https  tcp-443
SnV    syslog udp-514
SnV    sql-server  tcp-1433
SnV    sql-browser udp-1434
SnV    mqtt  tcp-1883
$ 
```

The only web ports that were created were the standard 80 and 443 ports. Luckily, one of your colleagues has been working on a script and has built one that you can use to correct this.
```python

#!/usr/bin/env python

import cobra.mit.access
import cobra.mit.request
import cobra.mit.session
import cobra.model.fv
import cobra.model.vz
import cobra.model.pol
from cobra.internal.codec.xmlcodec import toXMLStr

# log into an APIC and create a directory object
ls = cobra.mit.session.LoginSession('https://admin', 'admin', 'password')
md = cobra.mit.access.MoDirectory(ls)
md.login()

# the top level objects on which operations will be made
polUni = cobra.model.pol.Uni('')
fvTenant = cobra.model.fv.Tenant(polUni, name=u'SnV')

# create filter entries in tenant
vzFilter = cobra.model.vz.Filter(fvTenant, name=u'http-alt')
vzEntry = cobra.model.vz.Entry(vzFilter, etherT=u'ip', prot=u'tcp', dFromPort=u'8080', name=u'tcp-8080', dToPort=u'8080')
vzFilter2 = cobra.model.vz.Filter(fvTenant, name=u'https-alt')
vzEntry2 = cobra.model.vz.Entry(vzFilter2, etherT=u'ip', prot=u'tcp', dFromPort=u'8443', name=u'tcp-8443', dToPort=u'8443')

# assign filters to contract
vzBrCP = cobra.model.vz.BrCP(fvTenant, name=u'web-ui')
vzSubj = cobra.model.vz.Subj(vzBrCP, name=u'http-alt')
vzRsSubjFiltAtt = cobra.model.vz.RsSubjFiltAtt(vzSubj, tnVzFilterName=u'http-alt')
vzSubj2 = cobra.model.vz.Subj(vzBrCP, name=u'https-alt')
vzRsSubjFiltAtt2 = cobra.model.vz.RsSubjFiltAtt(vzSubj2, tnVzFilterName=u'https-alt')

# commit the configuration
c = cobra.mit.request.ConfigRequest()
c.addMo(topMo)
md.commit(c)

```

### Evolution X is Working
The application team has confirmed that since the contract was updated, their application is working as expected!

Getting the Learning Labs Code
==============================

If the working directory is not already created at `c:\acitoolkit`, follow these instructions.

* Open the windows command prompt
* Execute `cd \`
* Execute `git clone https://github.com/datacenter/acitoolkit.git`

You will now find a directory in `c:\acitoolkit` in which to perform the rest of the lab.

Running the Learning Labs Code
==============================
In this step we will walk you through the implementation of the ``tutorial.py`` file found in the ``acitoolkit/samples`` directory.  This code will create a simple tenant configuration that will configure 2 interfaces on the fabric to be on the same network so that they can communicate. This code can be executed from a ``Command Prompt`` with the following command from within the ``acitoolkit/samples`` directory::
```
   cd acitoolkit\samples
   py -2 tutorial.py
```
Before running the code, there is a simple configuration step to be performed. Please follow the instructions provided in the next section.

####Credential Setup

In order to access the APIC server, the correct IP address and login credentials need to be set up. Configuration is stored in the ``acitoolkit/samples/credentials.py`` file. To set it up, please follow these steps:

* Open a Windows console by double clicking the "cmd - src directory" icon on the Desktop.

![Figure](/posts/files/ACI-Learning-Modules/Foundation/Module 8 - ACI Toolkit/s2.png)


* Copy the following commands (Select all lines and press CTRL-C).

```
    cd acitoolkit
    py -2 setup.py install
    cd samples
    echo LOGIN='admin' > credentials.py
    echo PASSWORD = 'cisco123' >> credentials.py
    echo IPADDR = '<DevNet_provided_IP>' >> credentials.py
    echo URL = 'https://' + IPADDR >> credentials.py
    echo [+] Configuration is ready!
```

* Paste the commands into the console window (right click and press Paste)

![Figure](/posts/files/ACI-Learning-Modules/Foundation/Module 8 - ACI Toolkit/s3.png)

* The output should be similar to the following:

![Figure](/posts/files/ACI-Learning-Modules/Foundation/Module 8 - ACI Toolkit/s4.png)

* Now, in the same console window, run the following command to open the lab source code:

```
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" tutorial.py
```

Lab Source Code Overview
-------------------------------

Once the credentials have been set up, let's have a look at the Lab's source code. The following sections provide descriptions for each part.

####Imports

The first part of the tutorial program consists of the ``import`` statements.  The acitoolkit module from the acitoolkit package is imported as is the credentials.py file.

```
   from acitoolkit.acitoolkit import *
   from credentials import *
```

The ``acitoolkit`` module within the acitoolkit package provides access to all of the acitoolkit configuration.

The ``credentials.py`` file contains the login credentials for the APIC server and may need modification if you are using your own device (see byod.html).

####Tenant Creation

All of the configuration will be created within a single tenant.  This is done by creating an instance of the Tenant class and passing it a string containing the tenant name.  **Use your name or initials to create a unique string.**

```
	# Replace 'john' with your name
   tenant = Tenant('john')
```

####Application Profile

The Application Profile contains all of the Endpoint Groups representing the application.  The next line of code creates the application profile.  It does this by creating an instance of the ``AppProfile`` class and passing it a string containing the Application Profile name and the ``Tenant`` object that this ``AppProfile`` will belong.

```
   app = AppProfile('myapp', tenant)
```

Note that many of the objects within the acitoolkit are created in this way, namely with a name and a parent object.  The parent object must be an instance of this class's parent class according to the acitoolkit object model.  The parent class of ``AppProfile`` is ``Tenant``.

####Endpoint Group

The Endpoint Group provides the policy based configuration for Endpoints that are members of the Endpoint Group.  This is represented by the ``EPG`` class.  In this case, we create an ``EPG`` with the name `myapp` and pass the ``AppProfile`` that we created to be the parent object.

```
   epg = EPG('myepg', app)
```

####Context and Bridge Domain

We also need an L3 namespace and L2 forwarding domain so we create the ``Context`` and ``BridgeDomain`` in the same manner as we did for the previous objects.  For both of these classes, the parent class is Tenant.

```
   context = Context('myvrf', tenant)
   bd = BridgeDomain('mybd', tenant)
```
We then associate the ``BridgeDomain`` instance with the ``Context`` instance.  This indicates that this ``BridgeDomain`` exists within this ``Context``.

```
   bd.add_context(context)
```

The ``EPG`` is then associated with the ``BridgeDomain`` that we created.

```
   epg.add_bd(bd)
```

Associating the tenant configuration with the network
-----------------------------------------------------

At this point, the tenant configuration is complete.  However, it is not bound to the physical network yet so let's connect the EPG to 2 interfaces.

####Physical Interfaces

First, we must create objects to represent the physical interfaces using the ``Interface`` class.  Interface objects are named using interface type, pod, node (switch), module (linecard), and port names.  In this case, the interface type is ``'eth'`` for ethernet and the interfaces are located in pod 1 on leaf switch 101 in module 1 within ports 15 and 16.

```
   if1 = Interface('eth', '1', '101', '1', '15')
   if2 = Interface('eth', '1', '101', '1', '16')
```

####VLANs

In order to allow multiple EPGs to connect to the same interface, the ACI fabric uses network virtualization technologies such as VLAN, VXLAN, and NVGRE to keep the traffic isolated.  In this case, we chose to use VLAN since it is the most ubiquitous and we chose to use the same encapsulation on both physical interfaces, namely VLAN 5.

The ``L2Interface class`` represents the virtual L2 network interface.  In this case, this is the VLAN attached to a given physical interface.  This is the interface where L2 protocols (such as spanning tree in traditional networks) run.  Link layer protocols such as LLDP run directly on the physical interface independent of VLANs.

We create the ``L2Interface`` and pass a name ``vlan5_on_if1``, the encapsulation technology ``vlan``, and the virtual network identifier ``5`` as part of the constructor.

```
   vlan5_on_if1 = L2Interface('vlan5_on_if1', 'vlan', '5')
```

We next associate this ``L2Interface`` to the desired physical interface.

```
   vlan5_on_if1.attach(if1)
```

And we repeat for the second physical interface.

```
   vlan5_on_if2 = L2Interface('vlan5_on_if2', 'vlan', '5')
   vlan5_on_if2.attach(if2)
```

Now, we simply associate the ``EPG`` with the ``L2Interface`` objects that we created.

```
   epg.attach(vlan5_on_if1)
   epg.attach(vlan5_on_if2)
```

Deploying to the ACI APIC
-------------------------

At this point, the entire configuration is done and all that is left is connecting to the APIC and deploying the configuration.

First, we log into the APIC.  This is done through the ``Session`` class.  We create an instance and pass it the login credentials, namely the ``URL``, ``LOGIN``, and ``PASSWORD``.

```
   session = Session(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
```

We also initiate the actual login.

```
   session.login()
```

Once the login is complete, we can now send our configuration to the APIC. This is done by calling the ``Session`` object with the ``push_to_apic`` function that requires a URL and the JSON data to send to the APIC.  All of the configuration for the application topology is collected under the ``Tenant``.  In order to get the URL to use and the JSON for our configuration, we simply call the ``Tenant`` instance with ``get_url`` and ``get_json`` respectively.

```
   resp = session.push_to_apic(tenant.get_url(), data=tenant.get_json())
```

The ``push_to_apic`` call returns an object.  This object is an instance of the ``Response`` class from the popular `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/#>` library which provides a rich set of return codes and status.  Here, we simply check that the call was successful.

```
   if resp.ok:
      print 'Success'
```

Before the push was executed, the APIC GUI shows just three tenents, ``common``, ``mgmt`` and ``infra`` (APIC GUI can be accessed <a href="https://10.10.20.57/" target="_blank">**here**</a>, using credentials ciscolivemilan/DevNet123):

![Figure](/posts/files/aci-107-aci-toolkit/assets/tenentsbefore.png)

After the push, note the new ``tutorial`` tenant and under its Application Profiles, a new profile named ``myapp`` and a new EPG named ``myepg``:  

![Figure](/posts/files/aci-107-aci-toolkit/assets/appprofile.png)

Also created under Networking are a Context of ``myvrf`` and a BridgeDomain of ``BD-mybd``:

Displaying the JSON Configuration
---------------------------------
At this point, we're done!  The configuration has been sent to the APIC.  Congratulations, you just programmed a datacenter fabric!  You would be able to see your new tenant tutorial within the APIC GUI with its new EPG and static path bindings.

The next few lines in the ``tutorial.py`` file simply (pretty) print what was sent to the APIC.  You can use this to manually edit the JSON if you wish to access the richer API on the APIC that the acitoolkit does not expose.

```
   print 'Pushed the following JSON to the APIC'
   print 'URL:', tenant.get_url()
   print 'JSON:', tenant.get_json()
```

Which produces the following output:
```
Pushed the following JSON to the APIC
URL: /api/mo/uni.json
JSON: {'fvTenant': {'attributes': {'name': 'tutorial'}, 'children': [{'fvAp': {'attributes': {'name': 'myapp'}, 'children': [{'fvAEPg': {'attributes': {'name': 'myepg'}, 'children': [{'fvRsBd': {'attributes': {'tnFvBDName': 'mybd'}}}, {'fvRsPathAtt': {'attributes': {'tDn': 'topology/pod-1/paths-101/pathep-[eth1/15]', 'encap': 'vlan-5'}}}, {'fvRsPathAtt': {'attributes': {'tDn': 'topology/pod-1/paths-101/pathep-[eth1/16]', 'encap': 'vlan-5'}}}, {'fvRsDomAtt': {'attributes': {'tDn': 'uni/phys-allvlans'}}}]}}]}}, {'fvCtx': {'attributes': {'name': 'myvrf', 'pcEnfPref': 'enforced'}, 'children': []}}, {'fvBD': {'attributes': {'name': 'mybd'}, 'children': [{'fvRsCtx': {'attributes': {'tnFvCtxName': 'myvrf'}}}]}}]}}
```
**Note: There may be couple of 'UnverifiedRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made' warnings in the initial output.  This is due to the default certificate that the APIC simulator is using, and can be ignored.**

<p>This tutorial will walk you through installing the acitoolkit using the sources so you will be able to edit the samples and even the acitoolkit source code if so desired.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<h4 id="git">Git</h4>
<p>You will be performing a 'git clone' of the code from the Git Repository. There are a number of ways of achieving this. For example, an IDE, such as Eclipse, can do this for you. Otherwise, if you don't already have the command line version, you can download and install it from here:</p>
<p>http://git-scm.com/downloads</p>
<h4 id="python">Python</h4>
<p>The Python website offers two major versions of Python: 3.x.x and 2.x.x, and you will need 2.x.x for this lab. If you already have Python installed, you can check the version by simply running it from a terminal or shell:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\Cisco&gt;python
Python 2.7.9 (default, Dec 10 2014, 12:28:03) ...</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, you can download and install it from here:</p>
<p>https://www.python.org/downloads</p>
<h4 id="editor">Editor</h4>
<p>If you'd like to modify the source code, then you'll need a text editor of some sort, and virtually any editor will do. But note that in Python, indentation is used to indicate nesting level, so <em>do not mix tabs with spaces in any given source file</em>.</p>
<p>One popular editor specifically &quot;tuned&quot; for Python is called 'idle' and it provides syntax coloring and code debugging. It is included in the Python 2.7.x install and can be invoked like so:</p>
<pre><code>python C:\Python27\Lib\idlelib\idle.py &lt;source.py&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>&lt;source.py&gt;</code> is the file you wish to edit.</p>
<h3 id="get-the-acitoolkit-library-and-tutorial">Get the acitoolkit library and tutorial</h3>
<p>Next, you must download the the acitoolkit into a directory of your choice. This is done using the git utility installed above:</p>
<pre><code>  git clone https://github.com/datacenter/acitoolkit.git</code></pre>
<h4 id="install">Install</h4>
<p>Next, cd into the created directory and install the acitoolkit::</p>
<pre><code>  cd acitoolkit
  python setup.py install</code></pre>
<p>Note that when installing on Mac or Linux, you will likely need to run this as root so preface the command with the <code>sudo</code> keyword as follows::</p>
<pre><code>  sudo python setup.py install</code></pre>
<h4 id="setting-login-credentials">Setting login credentials</h4>
<p>In the acitoolkit/samples directory there is a <code>credentials.py</code> file that contains the login credentials for the APIC and is shown (post edits) in its entirety below. It contains the following variables: <code>LOGIN</code>, <code>PASSWORD</code>, and <code>IPADDR</code>. These variables should be modified to the settings of your particular APIC.</p>
<pre><code>   LOGIN = &#39;admin&#39;
   PASSWORD = &#39;cisco123&#39;
   IPADDR = &#39;10.10.20.57&#39;
   URL = &#39;https://&#39; + IPADDR</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note: There may be another credentials.py file in the parent acitoolkit directory that is ignored and can be deleted. You should be modifying acitoolkit/samples/credentials.py.</strong></p>

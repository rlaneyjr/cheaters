## ACI Toolkit

A quote from one of our ACI engineers:
"Cisco, in its quest to embrace programmability, has created what is called the ACI Toolkit, which is basically a combination of an NX-OS like CLI and some custom python scripts. Although this toolkit doesn't allow you to do all configurations within ACI, it can be used to create and show the common configuration and administrative actions that may be used daily. It's also great for someone who is just starting to migrate to a more programmatic way of doing things, as it's easily understandable to folks used to common networking commands."

The toolkit's python libraries are all available on GitHub.com and it's fairly simple to access. All you need to do is open a terminal window on your computer and enter the following command:

git clone https://github.com/datacenter/Simple-ACI-Toolkit

This command will download the necessary libraries to use the ACI Toolkit syntax. Then to run CLI commands from your APIC type:

python acitoolkitcli.py -l admin -p password -u https://APIC_IP

This will connect you to your APIC so you may run commands that will help you build your application network profiles. We can do things such as switching tenants, creating contexts, creating bridge domains, and creating end point groups (EPGs).

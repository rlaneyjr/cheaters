## ARYA

Arya is a tool that will convert APIC object documents from their XML or JSON form into the equivalent Python code, leveraging the Cobra SDK.

Arya supports input in a number of formats, including XML, JSON, a directory containing multiple xml or json documents, as well as standard input. The standard input option is very useful for use as a filter in most text editors, where one can copy the JSON or XML extracted from APIC Visore or API inspector, and quickly generate the Python source code framework, which can then be modified, tokenized and rapidly turned into functional prototypes.

Note that arya is a very useful tool for the heavy lifting of converting object model into source code, however it does not validate configuration, perform advanced lookup logic or implement a number of best practices that should be followed, such as performing lookups to validate targets, referencing object attributes instead of hardcoding DNS and names, and other proper coding practices

It is strongly recommended that for advanced use cases, getting expert advice and validating your code, you reach out to Cisco Advanced Services for support. For more information, visit http://www.cisco.com/go/aci

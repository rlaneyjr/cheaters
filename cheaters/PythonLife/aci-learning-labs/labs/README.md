# ACI Learning Modules

**Description**:  These tutorials will provide an introduction to ACI CLI, programing interfaces, and helpful tools.  It is written to be displayed within the [Cisco DevNet Learning Labs system](https://learninglabs.cisco.com).

  - **Technology stack**: Built using Markdown.
  - **Status**:  Beta status.

Contributions to these Learning Modules are welcome. However please keep in mind the following guidelines:
- All contributions should be example-intensive with lots of specific code snippets, pictures and diagrams. The goal of these learning labs is to ensure a 'hands-on' learning approach rather than just theory or instructions.  
- Note that contributions to these learning modules will be posted for public consumption. As such, you must ensure you have the rights to provide any contributed content.
- All modules are written in Markdown.  See below for helpful links and editors to improve your Markdown skills.
 
## Table of Contents for all Modules
Since the number of modules is fluid depending on additional contributions, the modules are not ordered.  However, below is the order in which they should be completed:

ACI Lab Modules:
- ACI 101 - APIC Interfaces
- ACI 102 - API Overview
- ACI 103 - Building A Simple Script
- ACI 104 - Cobra SDK
- ACI 105 - ACI Tools Overview
- ACI 106 - The Arya Tool
- ACI 107 - The acitoolkit API

## Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. [Markdown Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

If you're new to Markdown or just use it to write simple README files for your Github projects, the current modules should serve as good examples of Markdown syntax.  In addition, [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a helpful guide.

#### Markdown Editors
You can write Markdown in a plain text editor but there are many desktop and web-based options which allow you to write and preview your work at the same time.  We recommend Visual Studio Code for a few reasons:
- Easy to use lightweight environment for coding (or writing Markdown)
- Available on MAC, Linux or Windows
- Github Client integration
- Great Markdown preview features native in the editor
- Very intuitive operation and structure

## Creating Scipts Using The SDK
We have created some very rudimentary APIC configurations so far with the Cobra SDK.  However, it has quite an extensive feature-set available, based on the underlying raw API from the APIC controller.  You can use the SDK for advanced configurations as well as gaining info from the ACI fabric.

There are a number of resources available to begin exploiting the Cobra SDK for use with advanced ACI functionality, including:

- **Arya:** In the ACI 106 learning lab we'll look at a tool, Arya, which allows us to quickly convert our ACI configurations into a Python program using the SDK.  This tool is invaluable in its ability to help us quickly learn how to program the ACI fabric using the Cobra SDK.
- **SDK Documentation:** Just as the .egg files and installation instructions for the Cobra SDK were available on the APIC webserver, so too is the API documentation.  You can access it by navigating in the user interface to Admin >> Documentation >> Python SDK documentation or by going to: https://{IP-of-APIC}/cobra/getting-started.html. Again, this is not available on the APIC Sim.

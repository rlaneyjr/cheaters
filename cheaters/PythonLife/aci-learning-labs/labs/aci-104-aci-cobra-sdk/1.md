# ACI 104: Cobra SDK 

## Learning Objectives

After Completing this module you will be able to:
- Install the ACI Cobra Software Development Kit (SDK)
- Create a simple Python program/script using the Cobra SDK
- Know where to find additional resources for working with the SDK

## Software Development Kit (SDK)
For those new to programming, you will likely soon be aquainted with the notion of Software Development Kits (or SDK's).  At it's core, an SDK is simply a collection of useful features (classes and functions) created by a third party for use within your project. There is no official definition of what makes an SDK but typically it inolves a set of libraries, code samples and documentation in a portable format so it can be imported into your project. A quick google search will demonstrate that SDK's exist for a wide variety of programming languages and use cases.

A good SDK is similar to an API in that it should abstract the underlying complexity and provide a standard set of functions for users to take advantage of the underlying features.

## ACI Cobra SDK
Cisco has developed the Cobra SDK for ACI.  This is a Python SDK designed to abstract some of the monotonous tasks in the API calls we've been using for the last few modules.  The SDK provides functions to login, configure and troubleshoot ACI - making it simpler to write scripts and programs for the APIC.  The underlying functionality in the SDK leverages the APIC API just as we have done up to this point. Just as the ACI Graphic User Interface is a program built on top of the API to enhance the user experience, so too is the Cobra SDK.

In this module we'll cover installing the Cobra SDK into your Python environment and begin writing ACI scripts with the SDK to showcase its ease of use compared to raw API calls. 

## Installing the Cobra SDK

The Cobra SDK is designed to operate with a Python 2.7.x Interpreter. Also, the specific version of the SDK you use should match the firmware version running on your APIC controllers.  The SDK is contained in two Python .egg files -  a logical structure embodying the release of the SDK version, including other metadata.  The most convenient way to ensure that you have the SDK version corresponding to your APIC controller is to download the two .eggs directly from your APIC.

The .egg files are available at:
```
https://<IP-of-APIC>/cobra/_downloads/index.html
```  

** Note ** that this local file directory on the APIC is only available on the actual APIC and not the ACI simulator.

If you are using a lab computer which already has the SDK installed than you can confirm that the version of the SDK by issuing the following command:
```
pip list
```

When the SDK is installed, the result should be similar to this output:

In this case, the SDK is for APIC version 1.2(1i).

Should you need to install or upgrade the SDK, instructions are also available via the controller at:

```
https://<IP-of-APIC>/cobra/install.html
``` 
Again, this applies only an actual APIC, not the simulator.

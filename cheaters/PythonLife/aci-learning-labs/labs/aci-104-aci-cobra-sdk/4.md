## Assignment: Add a Bridge Domain with the SDK
 Recall in module 2 that we use XML with a raw API post to add a bridge domain to a tenant.  Here is the XML we used:
 ```
<polUni>

	<fvTenant name="ExampleApiTenant" >
		<fvBD name="myBD">
			<fvRsCtx tnFvCtxName="myVRF" />
			<fvSubnet ip="192.168.1.1/24" />
		</fvBD>
	</fvTenant>
        
</polUni>
```

In this example, we added 'myBD' to 'ExampleApiTenant'.  But also note that 'myBD' was an MO with two child MO's associated with itself - it contained a single subnet, 192.168.1.1/24, and it was resolved as belonging to the 'myVRF' private network.

In the SDK these MO's are defined as:
```
cobra.model.fv.BD('parentManagedObject', name='Name')

cobra.model.fv.RsCtx('parentManagedObject', tnFvCtxName='name-of-private-L3-network')

cobra.model.fv.Subnet('parentManagedObject', ip='IP')
```

With this information, create a new bridge domain MO in the APIC, under the ExampleSdkTenant.  Add the 192.168.1.1/24 subnet to the bridge domain and resolve it to be part of the 'myVRF' private network.

## Solution
The code to complete the previous assignment is:
```python

# Python Modules
from cobra.mit.access import MoDirectory
from cobra.mit.session import LoginSession
from cobra.mit.request import ConfigRequest
import cobra.model.fv as fvModels

# APIC Login with Credentials
apicUrl = 'https://<IP-Of-APIC>'
apicUsername = 'username'
apicPassword = 'password'
loginSession = LoginSession(apicUrl, apicUsername, apicPassword)

moDir = MoDirectory(loginSession)
moDir.login()

# Create Bridge Domain
uniMo = moDir.lookupByDn((r'uni/tn-ExampleSdkTenant'))
fvBdMo = fvModels.BD(uniMo, name='myBD')
fvRsCtxMo = fvModels.RsCtx(fvBdMo, tnFvCtxName='myVRF')
fvSubnetMo = fvModels.Subnet(fvBdMo,  ip='192.168.1.1/24')

#Commit Changes and logout
cfgRequest = ConfigRequest()
cfgRequest.addMo(fvBdMo)
moDir.commit(cfgRequest)

moDir.logout()
```

Notice that the only new MO's are the bridge domain and its associated child objects.  As such, we can start our reference of the MoDirectory with the 'ExampleSdkTenant' tenant since it is the parent MO of the bridge domain.  When we commit our changes we only need to commit the new bridge domain and the child objects are automatically included.

## Application Program Interface

Just as with the CLI, the API exposes full access to the APIC for configuration, management, operation, troubleshooting and more.  The APIC API is REST-based which offers several advantages over the CLI when creating scripts and programs to interact with ACI.  For the purposes of this module, we'll assume basic knowledge of RESTful APIs. However, a detailed discussion of REST APIs is available in the [Coding 101 Rest Basics Learning Lab](/lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1). 

We can showcase APIC interaction with the API by creating another tenant and VRF in the fabric.  Just as there are several tools which can be used to access the Command Line Interface of a device, we have a variety of options for API access as well.  We can access the API directly from a script or program. However, for testing and learning a new API, it is often helpful to use a REST client to explicitly see the API call and response. For this purpose we'll use Postman, a Google Chrome browser plugin. If you are at a DevNet event, then Postman is already installed on the Chrome browser you are using. Otherwise, instructions on how to install and use Postman are available in the [Coding 101 Rest Basics Learning Lab](/lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1). These instructions demonstrate Postman using the APIC-EM API, not ACI. Since REST is not a protocol but a framework, no two RESTful APIs are identical.  Nevertheless, there are many similarities between these two APIs and minor differences will be addressed as we as we use Postman, below.

Note, before using Postman with the APIC, it may be necessary to accept the APIC's self-signed SSL certificate in your Chrome browser. Do so by opening your chrome browser and navigate here:

```
	https://<IP-of-APIC>
```

Click on **Proceed to &lt;IP-of-APIC&gt; (unsafe)**

#### Login to the APIC
We can now open the Postman browser add-on to execute a RESTful API call.  In this module and subsequent ones we will not include any headers in our REST calls from Postman.  Some of our calls will require a body (or payload) and some will not.  To represent these components of our REST commands, we will use the following format:

```
<HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)> <URI>
{
	JSON or XML Body included here if one is required...
} 
```

Note that we are using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for the body or payload of the REST call.  ACI also supports Extensible Markup Lanuage (XML) in the body of the API as well. We'll get into more specifics of the ACI API in the next module; for now let's focus on the basics of creating and confirming a new Tenant and VRF with JSON as the body format. However, before we can do that we first have to login to the APIC.  To do so we will execute the following in Postman:

```
POST https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/aaaLogin.json
{
	"aaaUser" : {
		"attributes" : {
			"name" : "username-for-APIC",
			"pwd" : "password-for-APIC"
		}
	}
}
```
If you are new to using Postman, below is a diagram showcasing how to enter this REST call into the tool. Once complete, hit 'send':
 
![Figure](/posts/files/aci-101-apic-interfaces/assets/Postman-Login.png)

You can confirm the REST call was successful with the response Code.  In the picture below, the response (or status) code is the well-known value, 200 - indicating the REST call was successfully received and a response returned. There are a number of common status Codes you can expect when working in a REST framework, including:
- Bad Request (400): Typically indicating a problem with the initial call 
- Not Found (404): The Server cannot be found
- Internal Server Error (500): The Server encountered an internal error
- Service Unavailable (503): The Server is busy and/or the operation timed out.

When a login message is accepted, the API returns a data structure that includes a session timeout period in seconds and a token that represents the session. The token is also returned as a cookie in the HTTP response header. 
 
![Figure](/posts/files/aci-101-apic-interfaces/assets/Postman-LoginResponse.png)

To maintain your session, you must send login refresh messages to the API if no other messages are sent for a period longer than the session timeout period. To send a refresh message, execute the following in Postman:

```
GET https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/aaaRefresh.json
no payload...
```

The response should include a status 200.

**Note** that if you do not send the next command before the session timeout (default=10 mins), you will need to issue the login command again.  If a timeout does occur, you will see a response code of 403:

![Figure](/posts/files/aci-101-apic-interfaces/assets/Token-Timeout.png)

Fortunately, like many configuration options in ACI, you can alter the timeout by sending a command to the API.  This time, we'll be issuing the command in XML to set the timeout to 1 hr:

```
POST https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/node/mo/.xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<pkiWebTokenData webtokenTimeoutSeconds="3600" dn="uni/userext/pkiext/webtokendata"/>
``` 
For example, this should look like the following in Postman:

![Figure](/posts/files/aci-101-apic-interfaces/assets/Postman-SetTimeout.png)

#### Create A Tenant and VRF with the API
Now that we have logged into the APIC, we'll create a new Tenant named ˜ExampleApiTenant. Unlike with the CLI, we can use the API to create as many managed object as we desire with a single API command.  So in this example we will also create a new Private Network called 'myVRF' in the same REST call. We'll do so by executing the following in Postman:

```
POST https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/node/mo.json

{
	"polUni": {
        "attributes" : {}
      	"children":[{
          	"fvTenant" : {
              	"attributes" : {
                  	"name" : "ExampleApiTenant"
              	}
              	"children": [{
              		"fvCtx": {
                        "attributes": {
                            "name": "myVRF"
                        }
                    }
              	}]
          	}
      	}]
	}
}
```
You may notice a similarity between the structure of this JSON payload and the file structure we saw in the CLI interface.  As we previously learned, the private network is contained in the Tenant, thus it is labelled as a 'child' object of the Tenant.  In the same way we can see that the Tenant is actually a child of the overall ACI system, known as the 'Policy Universe' (polUni).  We'll explore this hierarchical structure more in the next module.
    
Check for a status 200 response from this previous command to ensure the REST call was successful.


#### Confirm the New Tenant and VRF with the API
Similar to the CLI implementation, lets confirm that the Tenant and private-network were created.  First we can confirm the tenant by executing the following:
```
GET https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/node/class/fvTenant.json
no payload...
```

This API call should return a JSON model for each of the tenants in the APIC.  You should be able to note one of the results which contain a Distinguished Name (DN) with the value:

```
	uni/tn-<name-of-tenant>
```

In this case it will be 'uni/tn-ExampleApiTenant'.

![Figure](/posts/files/aci-101-apic-interfaces/assets/API-TenantDistinguishedName.png)

To confirm the private-network was created, execute the following:

```
GET	https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/node/mo/uni/tn-ExampleApiTenant/.json?query-target=subtree&target-subtree-class=fvCtx
no payload...
```

Again, we should see a JSON model in which the DN contains:

```
 	uni/tn-<name-of-tenant>/ctx-<name-of-private-network>
```

![Figure](/posts/files/aci-101-apic-interfaces/assets/API-VRFDistinguishedName.png)


We have now successfully created a new tenant and private-network using the APIC API.  In the next module we will explore these API calls in greater detail.

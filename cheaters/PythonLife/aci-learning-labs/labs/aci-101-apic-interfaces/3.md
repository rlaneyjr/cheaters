## Graphic User Interface

The last interface for the APIC is the Graphic User Interface (GUI).

As mentioned earlier, the GUI is actually a web-based program which leverages the API to access the APIC.  Since this lab is focused on API interaction with the APIC, we won't go through all of the steps to create a new tenant and private-network in the GUI.  For more information on GUI configurations please see the Cisco APIC Getting Started Guide, available [here]( http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/1-x/getting-started/b_APIC_Getting_Started_Guide.pdf).

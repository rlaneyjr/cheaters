### Using WebArya
WebArya is a Flask based application that is started from the terminal, and can be used with any web browser. The application runs on http://0.0.0.0:8888, so you can set up a central server for multiple people to use, or just run it on your local machine.

#### Starting the WebArya Service
When Arya is installed, the program is located in the webarya/webarya directory. Open a terminal and browse to that directory; the below directories and files are listed under the correct directory. 
```bash
$ cd directory/path/before/webarya/webarya/webarya
$ ls
hello.py  __init__.py  README.md  static  templates  webarya.py
```

Start WebArya by running the `webarya.py` program. WebArya defaults to using port 8888, but you can use a different port with the `-p` flag if needed.
```bash
$ python webarya.py
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8888/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger pin code: 102-464-421
```

Leave the terminal and open a browser to [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)

### WebArya Example
There are four basic steps to using WebArya:

1.  Collect sample configuration data from the GUI
2.  Use the sample data as input into WebArya to build a script
3.  Make necessary edits to the WebArya's output
4.  Execute the script

##### Download JSON in the GUI
The first step in building a script with WebArya is to obtain a sample configuration file to use as the input source. One way of getting this file is to download an existing configuration in the APIC GUI. The goal of this exercise is to build a new Application for the Heroes Tenant; you can use the existing "Save_The_Planet" application for the seed configuration. Follow these steps in the APIC GUI:

1. Click on Tenants on the top menu bar and choose the Heroes Tenant
  *  The left-hand menu bar populates with the objects related to the Heroes Tenant
2. Click on the arrow next to `Application Profiles` to expand its child objects
  *  The application `Save_The_Planet` is underneath the `Application Profiles` folder
3. Right-click on the `Save_The_Planet` application and choose `Save as...`

A new box should pop up with the download options

1. Select the follwing options:  
  * Only Configuration  
  * Subtree
  * JSON
2. Click DOWNLOAD

We had you choose "Only Configuration" since this limits the returned JSON file to only include an object's configuration properties, which is all that is needed to submit to WebArya. Non-configuration properties, such as stats and counters add clutter that can make it more difficult to read if you need to look back at it later.

The "Subtree" option includes all children from the Managed Object, which means WebArya will give us a more robust script that configures a complete Application Profile.

WebArya does support XML or JSON, we just prefer to use JSON.

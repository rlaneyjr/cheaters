# Creating ACI Scripts the Easy Way - WebArya
We already briefly introduced Arya and its usefulness in building Python Scripts. Arya, or **A**PIC **R**EST to p**Y**ton **A**dapter, makes building Python scripts easy by automatically generating a file that uses Cobra's classes and functions to build new configurations. These are the three main benefits of using Arya:

*  Shortens the time it takes to build a configuration script
*  Easier than reading through the API Documentation
*  Teaches how to use the API by example

### Webarya
This lab guides you through building a Python script using WebArya, which is just like Arya, but provides an easy to use web interface. We briefly mentioned in the "Programmability Options" lab that the APIC provides several options for gathering configuration data; this exercise walks you through using the **GUI Download** method.

## Step 6: Using the REST API to automate the process

We've spent a lot of time doing this manually, but the manual configuration can help you learn how ACI works. However, you don't want to have to go through all that every time you need to create a tenant, EPG, or any other object in ACI. Now we can start using the collections we've saved in Postman by changing the names of objects to create new objects.

1. Create a login
	* Login to the APIC as we have done in the ACI 101 learning lab.
        ```
        POST https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/aaaLogin.json
        {
            "aaaUser" : {
                "attributes" : {
                    "name" : "username-for-APIC",
                    "pwd" : "password-for-APIC"
                }
            }
        }
        ```
	* **NOTE:** You should add the Login POST to your saved collection in Postman.

2. Create a tenant
	* Open Postman.
	* Select "Create Tenant" under your collection.
	* In the body change the name of the tenant (fvtenant) to something like "DevNet_ACI_Tenant"
	* Instead of this:
	```
    POST https://<IP-Of-APIC>/api/node/mo/uni/tn-Test_ACI_Tenent.json
    {
        "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
        "dn": "uni/tn-Test_ACI",
        "name": "Test_ACI",
        "rn": "tn-Test_ACI",
        "status": "created"
        },
        "children": []
        }
    }
	```
	it should be this:
	```
    POST https://<IP-Of-APIC>/api/node/mo/uni/tn-Test_ACI_Tenent.json
    {
        "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
        "dn": "uni/tn-DevNet_ACI_Tenant",
        "name": "DevNet_ACI_Tenant",
        "rn": "DevNet_ACI_Tenant",
        "status": "created"
        },
        "children": []
        }
	}
	```
	* Click Send and make sure you receive a status of 200 OK.
	* Go to your APIC and click on Tenants.
	* You may need to click on All Tenants in the subheader to see your new Tenant.

3. Create a Private Network and Bridge Domain
	* We did this step at the same time, however, you could have done it separately as a more granular approach to creating things. For the purpose of this lab we will make the REST API call for both the Private Network and Bridge Domain at the same time. You may also create one big XML script and make only one REST API call for all of these steps.
	* In Postman click on Create VRF and BD.
	* Change the tenant name to DevNet_ACI_Tenant anywhere you see Test_ACI.
	* Change the IP address from 10.10.10.1 to 20.20.20.1
	* Nothing else technically needs to be changed because we are working within a new tenant. However, you can change the names of the VRF and BD if you like.
	* Example:
    ```json
    {  
    "fvTenant":{  
        "attributes":{  
            "dn":"uni/tn-DevNet_ACI_Tenant",
            "status":"modified"
        },
        "children":[  
            {  
                "fvBD":{  
                "attributes":{  
                    "dn":"uni/tn-DevNet_ACI_Tenant/BD-DevNet-BD1",
                    "mac":"00:22:BD:F8:19:FF",
                    "name":"DevNet-BD1",
                    "rn":"BD-DevNet-BD1",
                    "status":"created"
                },
                "children":[  
                    {  
                        "fvRsCtx":{  
                            "attributes":{  
                            "tnFvCtxName":"DevNet-VRF1",
                            "status":"created,modified"
                            },
                            "children":[  

                            ]
                        }
                    },
                    {  
                        "fvSubnet":{  
                            "attributes":{  
                            "dn":"uni/tn-DevNet_ACI_Tenant/BD-DevNet-BD1/subnet-[20.20.20.1/24]",
                            "ip":"20.20.20.1/24",
                            "rn":"subnet-[20.20.20.1/24]",
                            "status":"created"
                            },
                            "children":[  

                            ]
                        }
                    }
                ]
                }
            },
            {  
                "fvCtx":{  
                "attributes":{  
                    "dn":"uni/tn-DevNet_ACI_Tenant/ctx-DevNet-VRF1",
                    "name":"DevNet-VRF1",
                    "rn":"ctx-DevNet-VRF1",
                    "status":"created"
                },
                "children":[  

                ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    }
    ```
	* Click Send and make sure you receive a status of 200 OK.

4. Check that a Private Network and Bridge Domain were created in the APIC
	* Ensure you're in your new tenant.
	* Expand Networking.
	* Click on Private Networks.
	* On the right side you will see a topology with your new VRF and Bridge Domain.

5. Create an Application Network Profile
	* Click on Create Application Network Profile in your Postman collection.
	* Change the name of the tenant from Test_ACI to DevNet_ACI_Tenant.
	* Example:
	```json
	POST https://<IP-Of-APIC>/api/node/mo/uni/tn-DevNet_ACI_Tenant/ap-DevNet-AP1.json
    {
	 "fvAp": {
	  "attributes": {
	   "dn": "uni/tn-DevNet_ACI_Tenant/ap-DevNet-AP1",
	   "name": "DevNet-AP1",
	   "rn": "ap-DevNetAP1",
	   "status": "created"
	  },
	  "children": []
	 }
	}
	```
	* Click Send.
	* Check that you got a status of 200 OK.

6. Create an Endpoint Group
	* Click on Create Application Network Profile in your Postman collection
	* Change the name of the Tenant and AP to match your new settings.
	* Example:
    ```
    POST https://<IP-Of-APIC>/api/node/mo/uni/tn-DevNet_ACI_Tenant/ap-DevNet_AP1/epg-DevNet-Web.json
    {  
    "fvAEPg":{  
        "attributes":{  
            "dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI_Tenant/ap-DevNet-AP1/epg-DevNet-Web",
            "name":"DevNet-Web",
            "rn":"epg-DevNet-Web",
            "status":"created"
        },
        "children":[  
            {  
                "fvCrtrn":{  
                "attributes":{  
                    "dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI_Tenant/ap-DevNet-AP1/epg-DevNet-Web/crtrn",
                    "name":"default",
                    "rn":"crtrn",
                    "status":"created"
                },
                "children":[  

                ]
                }
            },
            {  
                "fvRsBd":{  
                "attributes":{  
                    "tnFvBDName":"DevNet-BD1",
                    "status":"modified"
                },
                "children":[  

                ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    }
    ```
	* Click Send.
	* Check that you received a status of 200 OK.
	* Check the APIC to see that a new EPG was created under Application Profiles.

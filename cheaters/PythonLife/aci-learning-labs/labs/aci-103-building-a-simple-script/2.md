## Step 1. Login to APIC and Open Postman

1. Open POSTMAN as we've done for the past two modules, and login, as we did in ACI 101:

	```
	POST https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/aaaLogin.json
	{
		"aaaUser" : {
			"attributes" : {
				"name" : "username-for-APIC",
				"pwd" : "password-for-APIC"
			}
		}
	}
	```
	
	As a refresher for Postman login, below is a diagram showing how to enter this REST call into the tool. Once complete, hit 'send':

2. This time we will also open the APIC GUI but using a browser to navigate to:
    ```
	   https://<IP-of-APIC> (e.g. 173.36.206.21)
    ```

## Step 2. Open the API Inspector in ACI and Start Running Manual Tasks

For more information on the API Inspector check out this link <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/1-x/api/rest/b_APIC_RESTful_API_User_Guide/b_IFC_RESTful_API_User_Guide_chapter_0100.html">API Inspector Documentation</a>

1. Open the API Inspector
    * In the upper right corner of the APIC GUI click on "Welcome, Admin" and select "Show API Inspector".
    * Minimize the API Inspector, but do NOT close it.

2. Create a tenant
    * NOTE: In this sandbox, the ACI fabric has already been configured so we can jump directly to creating tenants and other constructs. Networking in this lab environment is also limited and will differ from a production environment.
    * Click on "Tenants" at the top.
    * Click on "Add Tenant".
    * Give it the Name "Test_ACI".
    * Click Next.
    * Click Finish - Do not go on to create other constructs such as Layer 3 contexts or VRFs at this point.

3. Find payload in API Inspector and paste in Postman REST client
    * Maximize the API Inspector.
    * Uncheck the "Scroll to latest" option.
    * Search for "Test_ACI" - This will take you directly to the tenant you created called "Test_ACI" which shows you the method used as well as the payload. Look for the method "POST" and the URL below it.
    * Note the method used is "POST" and not "GET".
    * Copy the URL it's contacting which should be the the URL of the APIC. This is shown right below the method.
    * Open Postman and change the method to POST.
    * Paste the URL next to POST.
    * Find the payload right below the URL.
    * Copy the payload containing your **fvtenant** called "Test_ACI" - everything after the word "Payload." It should look something like this:
        ```json
        {
          "fvTenant": {
           "attributes": {
            "dn": "uni/tn-Test_ACI",
            "name": "Test_ACI",
            "rn": "tn-Test_ACI",
            "status": "created"
           },
           "children": []
          }
         }
        ```
    * Make sure you click on Body in Postman and then paste the payload in. You may need to select raw in the subheader. See the picture below for a screen shot of how it looks when you're done.
    * <a href="http://s25.photobucket.com/user/Goody3335/media/CreateTenant.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c93/Goody3335/CreateTenant.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo CreateTenant.jpg"/></a>
    * Once you've pasted in the payload you can click the disk icon in the top right and select "Add to Collection".
    * Create a new collection called "ACI-DevNet".
    * Type in a Request name such as "Create Tenant".
    * If you like, add in a description.
    * Click on "Add to Collection".
    * Now you'll see the ACI-DevNet Collection when you click on Collections on the left. This will save the API call for later use.

## Review
Now we have created most of the components of a network in ACI.  Before moving on, go back to your collection in Postman and re-run the Create Tenant POST call, except this time do not change the name of the Tenant.  Your API call should look like this:
```
POST https://<IP-Of-APIC>/api/node/mo/uni/tn-Test_ACI.json
{  
   "fvTenant":{  
      "attributes":{  
         "dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI2",
         "name":"Test_ACI2",
         "rn":"tn-Test_AC2I",
         "status":"created"
      },
      "children":[  

      ]
   }
}
```

When you execute this API call, it will likely fail. You will get a status 400 and a error mentioning that this Tenant already exists.

But in earlier modules we were able to modify an object already created.  This issue is caused by the line:
```
"status":"created"
```

To resolve this issue we can remove this line altogether and rely on the forgiving model to fill in the appropriate satus.  The other option is to change it to the following:
```
"status":"modified"
```

## Assignment: Create A Database EGP
Many applications today are data driven and web servers often need to be connected to database applications. For this assignment modify the existing EPG saved API call in your Postman collection.  Give the EGP a name such as DevNet-DB.  Once complete run this API call.

## Solution

The modified API call should look similar to this:
```
POST https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/node/mo/uni/tn-Test_ACI/ap-DevNet-AP1/epg-DevNet-DB.json
{  
   "fvAEPg":{  
      "attributes":{  
         "dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI/ap-DevNet-AP1/epg-DevNet-DB",
         "name":"DevNet-DB",
         "rn":"epg-DevNet-DB"
      },
      "children":[  
         {  
            "fvCrtrn":{  
               "attributes":{  
                  "dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI/ap-DevNet-AP1/epg-DevNet-DB/crtrn",
                  "name":"default",
                  "rn":"crtrn"
               },
               "children":[  

               ]
            }
         },
         {  
            "fvRsBd":{  
               "attributes":{  
                  "tnFvBDName":"DevNet-BD1"
               },
               "children":[  

               ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}  
```

## Assignment: Add a Contract
** Note: ** This is a stretch assignment only for those that have an understanding of how to create and add contracts in ACI.
 
In order for network traffic to flow between these two EPG's we will need to add a contract.  Create a Contract called "AllTraffic" with a Subject also called "All Traffic".  In this subject, add the default filter from the common tenant.  Add this contract to the "DevNet-AP1" profile with "DevNet-Web" as the consumer and "DevNet-DB" as the provider.

Use the API inspector to add these steps to the collection in Postman.

## Solution
Tree additonal API calls are required to create this contract and attach it to the Application Profile.  First Create the contract:

```
POST https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/node/mo/uni/tn-Test_ACI_Tenant/brc-AllTraffic.json
{  
   "vzBrCP":{  
      "attributes":{  
         "dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI_Tenant/brc-AllTraffic",
         "name":"AllTraffic",
         "rn":"brc-AllTraffic",
         "status":"created"
      },
      "children":[  
         {  
            "vzSubj":{  
               "attributes":{  
                  "dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI_Tenant/brc-AllTraffic/subj-AllTraffic",
                  "name":"AllTraffic",
                  "rn":"subj-AllTraffic",
                  "status":"created"
               },
               "children":[  
                  {  
                     "vzRsSubjFiltAtt":{  
                        "attributes":{  
                           "status":"created",
                           "tnVzFilterName":"default"
                        },
                        "children":[  

                        ]
                     }
                  }
               ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

Next, attach the consumer EPG to this contract:

```
POST https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/node/mo/uni/tn-Test_ACI_Tenant/ap-DevNet-AP1/epg-DevNet-Web.json
{  
   "fvRsCons":{  
      "attributes":{  
         "tnVzBrCPName":"AllTraffic"
      },
      "children":[  

      ]
   }
}
```

Finally, attach the producer EPG:

```
https://<IP-of-APIC>/api/node/mo/uni/tn-Test_ACI_Tenant/ap-DevNet-AP1/epg-DevNet-DB.json
{  
   "fvRsProv":{  
      "attributes":{  
         "tnVzBrCPName":"AllTraffic"
      },
      "children":[  

      ]
   }
}
```

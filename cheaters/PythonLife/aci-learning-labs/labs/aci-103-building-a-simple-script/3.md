## Step 3. Create a Private Network and Bridge Domain

1. Minimize the API Inspector

2. Create a Private Network and Bridge Domain
    * NOTE: In this sandbox environment, the ACI fabric has already been configured so we can jump directly to creating tenants and other constructs. Networking in this lab environment is also limited and will differ from a production environment.
    * NOTE: We're going to create both a Private Network, or VRF, and a Bridge Domain at the same time. We could do these separately, though, and save more granular requests for later use.
    * Ensure you are in Tenants and have selected the Test_ACI tenant.
    * Expand Networking on the left.
    * Right-click on Private Networks and select Create Private Network.
    * Give it a name such as DevNet-VRF1.
    * Click Next.
    * Give the Bridge Domain a name such as DevNet-BD1.
    * Click on the + sign to give it a subnet and type in 10.10.10.1/24
    * Click Finish.

3. Get the payload in the API Inspector
    * Bring up the API Inspector
    * Make sure Scroll to Latest is not checked
    * Search for "DevNet-VRF1" and copy the payload that's listed under the POST method.
    * It should look like this: 
        ```
        {"fvTenant":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI","status":"modified"},"children":[{"fvBD":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI/BD-DevNet-BD1","mac":"00:22:BD:F8:19:FF","name":"DevNet-BD1","rn":"BD-DevNet-BD1","status":"created"},"children":[{"fvRsCtx":{"attributes":{"tnFvCtxName":"DevNet-VRF1","status":"created,modified"},"children":[]}},{"fvSubnet":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI/BD-DevNet-BD1/subnet-[10.10.10.1/24]","ip":"10.10.10.1/24","rn":"subnet-[10.10.10.1/24]","status":"created"},"children":[]}}]}},{"fvCtx":{"attributes":{"dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI/ctx-DevNet-VRF1","name":"DevNet-VRF1","rn":"ctx-DevNet-VRF1","status":"created"},"children":[]}}]}}
        ```
    * That's actually pretty ugly and we can paste it in the Postman client like that, but if we want to make it more readable for later use we can use what some call a "beautifier." You can Google any kind of beautifier, but one I use is at http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com.
    * Browse to the beautifier and paste your code in. Click Process and copy the formatted JSON code.
    * It will look like this:
```json
    {  
   "fvTenant":{  
      "attributes":{  
         "dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI",
         "status":"modified"
      },
      "children":[  
         {  
            "fvBD":{  
               "attributes":{  
                  "dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI/BD-DevNet-BD1",
                  "mac":"00:22:BD:F8:19:FF",
                  "name":"DevNet-BD1",
                  "rn":"BD-DevNet-BD1",
                  "status":"created"
               },
               "children":[  
                  {  
                     "fvRsCtx":{  
                        "attributes":{  
                           "tnFvCtxName":"DevNet-VRF1",
                           "status":"created,modified"
                        },
                        "children":[  

                        ]
                     }
                  },
                  {  
                     "fvSubnet":{  
                        "attributes":{  
                           "dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI/BD-DevNet-BD1/subnet-[10.10.10.1/24]",
                           "ip":"10.10.10.1/24",
                           "rn":"subnet-[10.10.10.1/24]",
                           "status":"created"
                        },
                        "children":[  

                        ]
                     }
                  }
               ]
            }
         },
         {  
            "fvCtx":{  
               "attributes":{  
                  "dn":"uni/tn-Test_ACI/ctx-DevNet-VRF1",
                  "name":"DevNet-VRF1",
                  "rn":"ctx-DevNet-VRF1",
                  "status":"created"
               },
               "children":[  

               ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

4. Paste the payload into the Postman Client
    * Open the Postman client.
    * Since you've already saved the Create Tenant request you can click the X on that tab.
    * Change the method from GET to POST.
    * Again enter the URL of your APIC.
    * Click Body and Raw and then paste the beautified payload in the Body.
    * Click the disk icon to save this into your ACI-DevNet collection with the Request Name of "Create VRF and BD".

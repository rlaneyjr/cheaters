### Management Information Tree
Managed Objects are connected in parent/child relationships forming the Management Information Tree, or MIT. Every MO has a parent, except for "Root." The MIT is used to add, remove, or query objects by referencing the object's parents up to Root. Objects can also have relationships outside of the parent/child paradigm. An example is the "app" EPG object being a child of the "Save_The_Planet" App Profile, but also having relationships with Bridge Domain and Contract objects.

Relationships can be 1 to 1, 1 to many, or many to many. The diagram that follows illustrates part of the Tenant tree and highlights the different ways objects can be related.

These relationships are important because they determine what resources are available to the objects contained within the relationship. Here is a concrete example to demonstrate these dependencies.

Here are a few things to note from this diagram:

1.  Objects can be uniquely identified in relation to their parent object.
    *  EPG (fvAEPg) "Web" is used twice, but is unique since they have different parent objects
2.  All IP Addresses (fvIp) in "Heroes" must be unique since both Bridge Domains (fvBD) belong to the same VRF (fvCtx)
3.  MAC Addresses can be duplicated as long as the Endpoints (fvCEp) belong to EPGs related to different Bridge Domains
    *  Superpower/Database/0000.1111.2222 forms a relationship with fvBD "Private"
    *  Superpower/Web/0000.1111.2222 forms a relationship with fvBD "General"
4.  The EPG/Bridge Domain relationship determines what Subnets (fvSubnet) the Endpoints can use
    *  Superpower/Database/0000.1111.2222 must use an IP in 10.1.2.0/24
    *  All other EPGs must use an IP in 10.1.1.0/24

Three things we can glean from this discussion of the MIT as it relates to programming are:

*  Configurational and Statistical data is accessed by referencing the Managed Object
*  Objects are accessed/created by starting at "Root" and working down the tree to the unique object
*  Programs need to take into account relationships between objects
    -  What arguments should be included when a function or program is used?
        +  EX: Creating an EPG requires the Tenant and Application objects in order to correctly place it in the MIT, and requires a Bridge Domain to connect the Endpoints to the correct Subnets and VRF.
    -  What tests should be performed before deleting an object?
        +  EX: Before deleting a Bridge Domain, check to see if any EPGs have a relationship with the BD.

### ACI Programmability Aids
It was previously stated that the Cobra libraries were more complex than using the Toolkit library; fortunately Cisco provides some tools to help administrators easily overcome this. 

#### Arya - Simplifying Cobra's Complexity
Arya, the **A**PIC **R**est p**Y**thon **A**dapter, will asist with generating a Python Script that uses the Cobra libraries. Arya takes either XML or JSON configuration data as inputs and outputs the Python code that would be used to generate the same configuration.  Yes, Arya does in fact auto-generate code for you!

You should always review the script for accuracy and make any changes that are required. You will likely need to change the APICs URL, Username, and Password that the script uses to establish a connection with the APIC. Also, if you submitted XML or JSON of an existing configuration, then you will need to change the necessary configuration parameters for the new object.

The "Webarya" lab provides more details about Arya, and has you use it to build Cobra Scripts.

#### Configuration Sources
It is great that Arya provides you an easy way to generate Python scripts automatically, but that still leaves the problem of obtaining the source configuration data to load into Arya. The APIC comes with three more tools that assist in providing the configuration data for you.

* The **GUI Download** feature allows you to download an existing object's configuration as XML or JSON
* **Visore** is an object browser that also has an XML download option
* The **API Inspector** is used to obtain URL and configuration data as API requests are made to the APIC.

You will learn more about these tools in the Webarya and ACI API labs.

### Managed Objects
For better or worse, everything within an ACI fabric is an object. These objects are called Managed objects, and frequently referred to as MOs. Each MO belongs to a specific class, which determines what properties it has and how it functions. One of the functions of a Tenant object is to restrict adminstrative access to only priveledged accounts; this function would not belong to an object of the Contract class. We can compare the two classes in the APIC GUI

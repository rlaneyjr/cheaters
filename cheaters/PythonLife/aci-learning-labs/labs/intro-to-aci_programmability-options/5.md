### ACI Programmability
ACI was built with programmability in mind, and designed to be configured and maintained through a central controller via a REST API. This API is how admins interact with the object-model, which allows them to make changes, gather stats, and troubleshoot the ACI fabric.

The Rest API uses HTTP and supports all four CRUD methods:

*  Create new objects
*  Read objects to view confguration and statistical data
*  Update existing objects
*  Delete objects that are no longer needed

We will use Postman to perform Read and Update methods using the RN and DN information from the previous page.

#### APIC Login
The Intermediate ACI API lab goes into more detail of using the API, but for this excercise you need to know that login and configuration changes use HTTP POST and reading data uses HTTP GET.

Postman uses Chrome, so you need to login to the APIC GUI if it is using a self-signed certificate. Go ahead and open a browser to the APIC and browse to "Tenants."

Now open Postman and login to the APIC:
```json
Method: POST
URL: https://198.18.133.200/api/aaaLogin.json
Body:
{
    "aaaUser": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "admin",
            "pwd": "C1sco12345"
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure that it returns "200 OK"

#### Read
In order to make a Read request, change the HTTP method to GET. You will make a class query for all Applications configured on the ACI fabric; use the below URL and hit "Send" to view the response data. Notice that the URL combines the Application Profile's module and class names to perform the query.

```
Method: GET
URL: https://198.18.133.200/api/class/fvAp.json?
```

The response body lists out every Application Profile and provides a dictionary with each of their attributes.

#### Update
Update requests use the HTTP POST method, so make sure to change that in Postman. Update requests require the URL to use the MOs DN, and a body with the information that needs to be updated. The below URL and body will add a description to the Heroes Tenant.
```json
Method: POST
URL: https://198.18.133.200/api/mo/uni/tn-Heroes.json
BODY:
{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "name": "Heroes",
            "descr": "Modify Tenant",
            "status": "modified"
        }
    }
}
```

The body of this request uses the "descr" attribute to add a description to the Tenant. The "status" attribute is also included to inform the APIC that this request is for updating an existing object. A "200 OK" confirms that the update was successful.

Look back at the APIC GUI, and the "Heroes" now has a description.

We used Postman to interact with the REST API, however this same API is actually used by all interfaces that communicate with the APIC, including:

*  GUI
*  CLI
*  ACI Toolkit
*  Cobra SDK

The rest of this lab introduces ACI Toolkit and Cobra, and future labs will have you use these and other tools to interact with the API.

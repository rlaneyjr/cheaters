### Relative Names
Each MO has **Relative Name (RN)**, which identifies an object from other child objects of the same parent. Although each RN must be unique within the parent object, they can be duplicated in another parent.

A Relative Name begins with a **class prefix**, and is based off the object's class type. The last part of the RN comes from the **property identefier** that the class uses to identify an object; typicaly the "name" property. The EPG prefix is "epg-" and the property identifier is "name." Looking at the above tree diagram, both "Web" EPGs would have the same RN, "epg-Web." Here is a table of commonly used prefixes and property IDs:

| **Common Name** | **Prefix-Property** | **Module** | **Class** | **Parent Class** | **Example** |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Tenant | **tn**-name | fv | Tenant | Uni | tn-Heroes |
| Context/VRF | **ctx**-name | fv | Ctx | Tenant | ctx-Corporate |
| Bridge Domain | **BD**-name | fv | BD | Tenant | BD-General |
| Subnet | **subnet**-ip | fv | Subnet | BD | subnet-10.1.2.1/24 |
| App Profile | **ap**-name | fv | Ap | Tenant | ap-Superpower |
| EPG | **epg**-name | fv | AEPg | Ap | epg-Database |
| Client Endpoint | **cep**-name | fv | CEp | AEPg | cep-0000.1111.2222 |
| IP Address | **ip**-addr | fv | Ip | CEp | ip-10.1.2.20 |
| L3 External | **out**-name | l3ext | Out | Tenant | out-Corporate |
| Filter | **flt**-name | vz | Filter | Tenant | flt-HTTP |
| Contract | **brc**-name | vz | BrCP | Tenant | brc-Web_Services |
| Contract Subject | **subj**-name | vz | Subj | BrCP | subj-HTTP |

RNs can be used to access an object if you are currently located under the parent object. They are frequently used to filter the results of API queries.
>EX: An application owner reports issues with a particular host; in order to look into the issue, a network admin can query the fvCEp Class and return only the objects with a child fvIp of 10.1.1.20 (ip-10.1.1.20).

### Distinguished Names
We noted in the MIT that an object can be identified by referencing their parent object; we call this an object's **Distinguished Name (DN)**. By definitition, every object in the MIT has a unique DN.

The Distinguished Name consists of a series of RNs starting with root and attaching each child RN down to the object: dn = root/{rn}/{rn}/{rn}. We found that two of the EPGs in our tree have the same RN, however their DNs are distinct:

*  uni/tn-Heroes/**ap-Save_The_Planet**/epg-Web
*  uni/tn-Heroes/**ap-Healing**/epg-Web

Usually you start with an object's ID and need to build the DN in reverse. Here is an example of building the DN for a "Web" EPG, which is useful for finding the Endpoints associated with a particular service. There are multiple "Web" EPGs, so building the proper DN is critical to getting the correct results. For this example, the application is "Superpower."

1.  Build the object RN: **epg-Web**
2.  Recursively build the parent objects to root:
    *  fvAp is the parent class, and "Superpower" is the specific fvAp object: **ap-Superpower**/epg-Web
    *  fvTenant is the next parent class, and "Heroes" is the specefic  fvTenant object: **tn-Heroes**/ap-Superpower/epg-Web
    *  Root is the parent of fvTenant: **uni**/tn-Heroes/ap-Superpower/epg-Web
3.  The full DN is **uni/tn-Heroes/ap-Superpower/epg-Web**

Distinguished Names are used to make API requests for a specific object.
>EX: To view the faults and log data for the Application "Save_The_Planet," the API request uses the unique DN, "uni/tn-Heroes/ap-Save_The_Planet," as part of the request URL.

Now that we have an overview of the object model, let's take a look at the various ACI programmability options that exist.

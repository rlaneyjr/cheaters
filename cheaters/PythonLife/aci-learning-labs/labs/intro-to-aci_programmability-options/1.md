# ACI Programmability Options
Before we take look at the programmability options of ACI, let's review the current state of network programmabliity, or lack thereof.

Networks have traditionally been built with devices designed to be configured and maintained on a per device basis. To make changes or troubleshoot, a network engineer must connect to multiple devices individually and enter commands on the CLI, an interface that was built to be consumed by humans. This solution works fine for static environments, but does not scale and is prone to human error as changes are made more frequently and repetitively.  Since the CLI was built for humans, it is also a less than ideal interface for programmability and automation.

This is the core problem ACI solves for data center operations.  ACI has a robust and diverse set of programmability options and this is made possible due to the ACI Object Model.

### The Object Model
In "Understanding ACI," it was stated that ACI operates using an object-based model, which is used to configure and view statistical data. Before looking at programmatic methods of interacting with ACI, you must have a foundational understanding of how this object-model works. The object model can be divided into two catagories: the logical and concrete.

Administrators and management tools interact with the logical model through the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC). Changes made to the logical model are pushed down to the concrete model where the hardware and software are programmed as needed. Separating the logical and concrete creates a single management interface to define desired states, instead of managing the network on a per device basis, which helps to simplify programming and automation stratagies.
>Example: An admin creates an EPG and assigns it VLAN 10. The Admin is working with the logical model. The logical model then pushes VLAN 10 to the concrete model by configuring VLAN 10 only on the switches that have hosts in the EPG.

Since Admins work in the logical model, we will spend our time discussing how this model works. The logical model is organized as a hierarchy of objects, with "root" being the top-level object.

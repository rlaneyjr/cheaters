### Cobra SDK
Cobra is a Python SDK that supports CRUD operations of an ACI fabric. Since this is a complete mapping of the object-model, it will be more complex than the ACI Toolkit Library.

A complete mapping of the object-model means:

*  The complete MIT is incorporated into the Cobra SDK
*  All operations accessible through the API can also be achieved via Cobra
*  The SDK is modeled after the MIT, so the Python class and property names will match what is in the MIT
  -  The Cobra module will be the letters up to the first capital letter
  -  The Cobra class will be the rest of the ID
  -  Examples:
    +  fvTenant: Module = fv, Class = Tenant
    +  l3extOut: Module = l3ext, Class = Out
  -  Properties can be accessed by calling ".property" on the object
  -  Examples:
    +  tenant.name
    +  endpoint.ip

Since Cobra offers full functionality, it is better suited for doing more complex queries with filters, incorporating L4-L7 device packages for network service devices external to ACI, and for creating initial fabric build scripts that configure less common tasks like snmp, syslog, spine BGP policy, etc.

#### Create a Cobra Tenant
As we did for ACI Toolkit, we now introduce Cobra by creating a new Tenant. Open a new Python interpreter session and follow this code snippet.
>If you are not using a credentials.py file, then you will need to create the URL, LOGIN, and PASSWORD variables.

```python
>>> from credentials import *
>>> import cobra.mit.access
>>> import cobra.mit.request
>>> import cobra.mit.session
>>> import cobra.model.fv
>>> import cobra.model.pol
>>> 
# connect to the apic
>>> auth = cobra.mit.session.LoginSession(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
>>> session = cobra.mit.access.MoDirectory(auth)
>>> session.login()
SSL Warning
>>> 
# create a new tenant
>>> root = cobra.model.pol.Uni('')
>>> new_tenant = cobra.model.fv.Tenant(root, "Cobra_Tenant")
>>> 
# commit the new configuration
>>> config_request = cobra.mit.request.ConfigRequest()
>>> config_request.addMo(new_tenant)
>>> session.commit(config_request)
SSL Warning
<Response [200]>
>>> 
```

We can immediately see that Toolkit abstracts some of the intricacies involved with using Cobra; however, Cobra also has tools that make it more accessible.

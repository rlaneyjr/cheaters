### Child Objects
We saw that our current query has only returned the object itself, and not any of its child objects. This section walks you through how to use a couple of more scoping properties to return "Save_The_Planet's" child objects.

Follow these code snippets:

#### Have the Query Return Child Objects
```python
# set the scope to subtree full
>>> app_query.subtree = "full"
>>> 
# demonstrate a typo; cobra provides the acceptable options
>>> app_query.queryTarget = "subtre"
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    (value, str(allowedValues)))
ValueError: "subtre" is invalid, valid values are "set(['self', 'subtree', 'children'])"
>>>
# scope the query to subtree
>>> app_query.queryTarget = "subtree"
>>> 
# look at the applied query scopes using .options
>>> app_query.options
'rsp-subtree=full&query-target-filter=eq(fvAp.name, "Save_The_Planet")&query-target=subtree'
>>> save_the_planet_app_subtree = session.query(app_query)
>>> 
```

#### View the Child Objects for the Query
```python
>>> save_the_planet_app_subtree
[<cobra.modelimpl.fv.ap.Ap object at 0x7f3c3c735150>]
>>> save_the_planet_app_subtree[0].numChildren
3
>>> for epg in save_the_planet_app_subtree[0].children:
...     print epg.dn
... 
uni/tn-Heroes/ap-Save_The_Planet/epg-web
uni/tn-Heroes/ap-Save_The_Planet/epg-app
uni/tn-Heroes/ap-Save_The_Planet/epg-db
>>> 
```

This exercise walked you through using queries in a python interpreter, but it is also a good idea to build scripts with them to quickly look for potential issues. A couple of examples would be:

1.  Return the Tenant, Application, and EPG for a given IP address
2.  Find an IP's physical port and returning the interface counters
  
We will also use queries in the next section to compare a new configuration request with what already exists on the fabric.

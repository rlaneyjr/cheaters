### Using the ACI Model Package
The model package is used to stage configurations, which can either be commited with the acicobra package, or discarded. In order to stage configurations, you will need to know the MIT structure, and the modules and classes required for all MOs from root to the new object. 

#### Staging Configurations
We will create a new EPG under the "Save_The_Planet" Application as an example of how to stage a configuration.

To build the MIT, it is easiest to start at the new object, and then work back to the root. In this example, our new object is of type EPG. EPGs are children of App Profiles ("Save_The_Planet"). The next class closer to root is Tenant ("Heroes"), which is directly under root('uni').

Now that we know what classes are required to build a new tenant, we can identify what modules are required to represent these objects. It turns out that Tenant, App Profile, and EPG classes are all under **cobra.model.fv**, and their class names are **Tenant**, **Ap**, and **AEPg**. We can start at the root of the MIT, **cobra.model.pol.Uni**, and build each child object from its parent.

Open a new terminal with a new python interpreter and follow these steps to stage the new EPG:
>If you are not using a credentials file, then you will need to provite the `URL`, `LOGIN`, `PASSWORD` variables with the correct information for your environment.

```python
# import classes
>>> from credentials import *
>>> import cobra.mit.session
>>> import cobra.mit.access
>>> import cobra.mit.request
>>> import cobra.model.pol
>>> import cobra.model.fv
>>> 
# establish a session with the APIC
>>> auth = cobra.mit.session.LoginSession(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
>>> session = cobra.mit.access.MoDirectory(auth)
>>> session.login()
>>> 
# build from root to the new epg
>>> root = cobra.model.pol.Uni('')
>>> tenant = cobra.model.fv.Tenant(root, "Heroes")
>>> app_profile = cobra.model.fv.Ap(tenant, "Save_The_Planet")
>>> epg = cobra.model.fv.AEPg(app_profile, "New_EPG")
>>> 
```

#### Submitting Configurations
The above example has only created the new EPG under the "Save_The_Planet" Application locally; it has not actually created any objects that are represented on the ACI fabric. To submit these requests, the acicobra package needs to be used again.
>When adding an object to the configuration request, the best practice is to add the new object closest to root to the configuration request. This example adds the "epg" object since it is the only new MO. If we had created a new applcation and epg instead, then only the application object would be added to the configuration request.


Use these steps to commit the new EPG to the APIC:
```python
# submit staged configuration to APIC
>>> config_request = cobra.mit.request.ConfigRequest()
>>> config_request.addMo(epg)
>>> session.commit(config_request)
SSL Warning
<Response [200]>
>>> 
```

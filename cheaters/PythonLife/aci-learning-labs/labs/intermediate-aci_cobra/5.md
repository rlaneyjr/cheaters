### Scoping Queries
The request class also supports scoping queries to filter results, and to include certain parts of the MIT. These scoping properties will correlate to one of the API methods discussed in "Peeling Back the ACI API."

These are some of the scoping options:

*  propFilter (query-target-filter) filters the results based on class attributes
*  queryTarget (query-target) specifies what part of the MIT to query
    -  self
    -  children
    -  subtree
*  classFilter (target-subtree-class) can be used when `queryTarget` is set to either "children" or "subtree" to filter the returned children to only objects of a specific class or classes.
*  subtree (rsp-subtree) specifies how much of the subtree to retrieve
    -  no
    -  children
    -  full
*  subtreeClassFilter (rsp-subtree-class) filters what subtree classes to include in the response
*  subtreeInclude (rsp-subtree-include) specifies what type of information to include in the subtree
    -  audit-logs
    -  event-logs
    -  faults
    -  health
    -  etc

The next few code blocks will demonstrate using a class query and how scoping affects what results are returned. First we will look at all applications configured on the APIC. Follow along in your own Python Interpreter.

#### Make a Class Query for All App Profiles
```python
>>> app_query = cobra.mit.request.ClassQuery('fvAp')
>>> 
>>> apps = session.query(app_query)
>>> apps
[<cobra.modelimpl.fv.ap.Ap object at 0x7f3c3c87b6d0>, <cobra.modelimpl.fv.ap.Ap object at 0x7f3c3c872a50>, 
<cobra.modelimpl.fv.ap.Ap object at 0x7f3c3c872b90>]
>>> for app in apps:
...     print app.name
... 
default
access
Save_The_Planet
>>>
```

#### Scope the Query to Applications Named "Save_The_Planet"
```python
# set the property filter to only return the app named "Save_The_Planet"
>>> app_query.propFilter = 'eq(fvAp.name, "Save_The_Planet")'
>>> save_the_planet_app = session.query(app_query)
>>> save_the_planet_app
[<cobra.modelimpl.fv.ap.Ap object at 0x7f3c3cdee310>]
>>> save_the_planet_app[0].name
Save_The_Planet
>>> 
# save_the_planet_app did not return any child objects for the application
>>> save_the_planet_app[0].numChildren
0
>>> 
```

### Using the ACI Cobra Package
The acicobra package contains the classes used to login, query, and submit configurations to the ACI fabric. We will walk you through using the login and query classes to get familiar with using the the acicobra package. Submitting Configurations will be covered with the acimodel package.

#### Credentials File
We use a `credentials.py` file in this lab to authenticate with the APIC.
If you are following along with your own device, then we suggest creating this file and saving it in your working directory. The file should look like this with updated parameters for your environment:
```
URL = 'https://198.18.133.200'
LOGIN = 'admin'
PASSWORD = 'C1sco12345'
```
 
We have also provided this file in the sample code repo.

#### Establishing a Session
The first step of any script will be to login, which requires the **session** and **access** modules.

Open a Python interpreter and follow this code block to establish a session with the APIC:
>If you are not using a credentials file, then you will need to provite the `URL`, `LOGIN`, `PASSWORD` variables with the correct information for your environment.

```python
$ python
>>> 
# import classes
>>> from credentials import *
>>> import cobra.mit.session
>>> import cobra.mit.access
>>> 
# establish a session with the APIC
>>> auth = cobra.mit.session.LoginSession(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
>>> session = cobra.mit.access.MoDirectory(auth)
>>> session.login()
SSL Warning
>>> 
```

Keep this window open, and we will use this session to make querries with the APIC. If you get an error later that your session has expired, just re-enter `session.login()`

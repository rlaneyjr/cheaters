Usage Examples
##############

To illustrate how Trigger works, here are some basic examples of leveraging the
API.

For these examples to work you must have already :doc:`installed
<installation>` and :doc:`configured <configuration>` Trigger, so if you
haven't already please do that first!

Simple Examples
===============

Working with metadata
---------------------

Get a count of all your devices:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from trigger.netdevices import NetDevices
    >>> nd = NetDevices()
    >>> len(nd)
    5539

(Whoa! That's a lot!) Let's look up a device.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dev = nd.find('edge1-abc')
    >>> dev.vendor, dev.deviceType
    (<Vendor: Juniper>, 'ROUTER')
    >>> dev.has_ssh()
    True

Get an interactive shell
------------------------

Since this device has SSH, let's connect to it:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dev = nd.find('edge1-abc')
    >>> dev.connect()
    Connecting to edge1-abc.net.aol.com.  Use ^X to exit.

    Fetching credentials from /home/jathan/.tacacsrc
    --- JUNOS 10.2S6.3 built 2011-01-22 20:06:27 UTC
    jathan@edge1-abc>

Work with access-lists
----------------------

Let's start with a simple Cisco ACL:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from trigger.acl import parse
    >>> aclobj = parse('access-list 123 permit tcp any host 10.20.30.40 eq 80')
    >>> aclobj.terms
    [<Term: None>]

And convert it to Juniper format:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> aclobj.name_terms()  # Juniper policy terms must have names
    >>> aclobj.terms
    [<Term: T1>]
    >>> print '\n'.join(aclobj.output(format='junos'))
    filter 123 {
        term T1 {
            from {
                destination-address {
                    10.20.30.40/32;
                }
                protocol tcp;
                destination-port 80;
            }
            then {
                accept;
            }
        }
    }

Cache your login credentials
----------------------------

Trigger will encrypt and store your credentials in a file called :ref:`.tacacsrc
<tacacsrc>` in your home directory. We already had them cached in the previous
examples, so I removed it and then:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from trigger.tacacsrc import Tacacsrc
    >>> tcrc = Tacacsrc()
    /home/jathan/.tacacsrc not found, generating a new one!

    Updating credentials for device/realm 'tacacsrc'
    Username: jathan
    Password:
    Password (again):
    >>> tcrc.creds['aol']
    Credentials(username='jathan', password='boguspassword', realm='tacacsrc')

Passwords can be cached by realm. By default this realm is ``'aol'``, but you
can change that in the settings. Your credentials are encrypted and decrypted
using a shared key. A more secure experimental GPG-encrypted method is in the
works.

Login to a device using the ``gong`` script
-------------------------------------------

Trigger includes a simple tool for end-users to connect to devices called
:ref:`gong <gong>`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gong foo1-cisco
    Connecting to foo1-cisco.net.aol.com.  Use ^X to exit.

    Fetching credentials from /home/jathan/.tacacsrc
    foo1-cisco#
    foo1-cisco#show clock
    20:52:05.777 UTC Sat Jun 23 2012
    foo1-cisco#

Partial hostnames are supported, too:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gong foo1
    2 possible matches found for 'foo1':
    [ 1] foo1-abc.net.aol.com
    [ 2] foo1-xyz.net.aol.com
    [ 0] Exit

    Enter a device number: 2
    Connecting to foo1-xyz.net.aol.com.  Use ^X to exit.

    Fetching credentials from /home/jathan/.tacacsrc
    foo1-xyz#

Slightly Advanced Examples
==========================

Execute commands asynchronously using Twisted
---------------------------------------------

This is a little more advanced... so we saved it for last.

Trigger uses Twisted, which is a callback-based event loop. Wherever possible
Twisted's implementation details are abstracted away, but the power is there
for those who choose to wield it. Here's a super simplified example of how this
might be accomplished:

.. code-block:: python

    from trigger.netdevices import NetDevices
    from twisted.internet import reactor

    nd = NetDevices()
    dev = nd.find('foo1-abc')

    def print_result(data):
        """Display results from a command"""
        print 'Result:', data

    def stop_reactor(data):
        """Stop the event loop"""
        print 'Stopping reactor'
        if reactor.running:
            reactor.stop()

    # Create an event chain that will execute a given list of commands on this
    # device
    async = dev.execute(['show clock'])

    # When we get results from the commands executed, call this
    async.addCallback(print_result)

    # Once we're out of commands, or we an encounter an error, call this
    async.addBoth(stop_reactor)

    # Start the event loop
    reactor.run()

Which outputs:

.. code-block:: bash

    Result: ['21:27:46.435 UTC Sat Jun 23 2012\n']
    Stopping reactor

Observe, however, that this only communicated with a single device.

Execute commands asynchronously using the Commando API
------------------------------------------------------

`~trigger.cmds.Commando` tries to hide Twisted's implementation details so you
don't have to deal with callbacks, while also implementing a worker pool so
that you may easily communicate with multiple devices in parallel.

This is a base class that is intended to be extended to perform the operations
you desire. Here is a basic example of how we might perform the same example
above using `~trigger.cmds.Commando` instead, but also communicating with a
second device in parallel:

.. code-block:: python

    from trigger.cmds import Commando

    class ShowClock(Commando):
        """Execute 'show clock' on a list of Cisco devices."""
        vendors = ['cisco']
        commands = ['show clock']

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        device_list = ['foo1-abc.net.aol.com', 'foo2-xyz.net.aol.com']
        showclock = ShowClock(devices=device_list)
        showclock.run() # Commando exposes this to start the event loop

        print '\nResults:'
        print showclock.results

Which outputs::

    Sending ['show clock'] to foo2-xyz.net.aol.com
    Sending ['show clock'] to foo1-abc.net.aol.com
    Received ['21:56:44.701 UTC Sat Jun 23 2012\n'] from foo2-xyz.net.aol.com
    Received ['21:56:44.704 UTC Sat Jun 23 2012\n'] from foo1-abc.net.aol.com

    Results:
    {
        'foo1-abc.net.aol.com': {
            'show clock': '21:56:44.704 UTC Sat Jun 23 2012\n'
        },
        'foo2-xyz.net.aol.com': {
            'show clock': '21:56:44.701 UTC Sat Jun 23 2012\n'
        }
    }

Get structured data back using the Commando API
-----------------------------------------------

`~trigger.cmds.Commando` will attempt to parse the raw command output into a
nested dict. The results from each worker are parsed through the `TextFSM
<http://jedelman.com/home/programmatic-access-to-cli-devices-with-textfsm/>`_
templating engine, if a matching template file exists within the
:setting:`TEXTFSM_TEMPLATE_DIR` directory.

For this to work you must have an attribute on your netdevices model that
specifies the network operating system, e.g. IOS, NX-OS or JUNOS. This will be
used to correlate the right template for a given device based on the naming
convention used by the TextFSM templates.

        # started with the file path as first argument:
        #
        # ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf

        # Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
        # it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
        #
        # 1k => 1000 bytes
        # 1kb => 1024 bytes
        # 1m => 1000000 bytes
        # 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
        # 1g => 1000000000 bytes
        # 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
        #
        # units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.

        # have a standard template that goes to all Redis servers but also need
        # to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include
        # other files, so use this wisely.
        #
        # Notice option "include" won't be rewritten by command "CONFIG REWRITE"
        # from admin or Redis Sentinel. Since Redis always uses the last processed
        # line as value of a configuration directive, you'd better put includes
        # at the beginning of this file to avoid overwriting config change at runtime.
        #
        # If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration
        # options, it is better to use include as the last line.

        # When running daemonized, Redis writes a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid by
        # default. You can specify a custom pid file location here.

        # will silently truncate it to the value of /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn so
        # make sure to raise both the value of somaxconn and tcp_max_syn_backlog
        # in order to get the desired effect.

        # By default Redis listens for connections from all the network interfaces
        # available on the server. It is possible to listen to just one or multiple
        # interfaces using the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or
        # more IP addresses.
        #
        # Examples:
        #
        # bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
        # bind 127.0.0.1

        # Specify the path for the Unix socket that will be used to listen for
        # incoming connections. There is no default, so Redis will not listen
        # on a unix socket when not specified.
        #
        # unixsocket /tmp/redis.sock

        # TCP keepalive.
        #
        # If non-zero, use SO_KEEPALIVE to send TCP ACKs to clients in absence
        # of communication. This is useful for two reasons:
        #
        # 1) Detect dead peers.
        # 2) Take the connection alive from the point of view of network
        #    equipment in the middle.
        #
        # On Linux, the specified value (in seconds) is the period used to send ACKs.
        # Note that to close the connection the double of the time is needed.
        # On other kernels the period depends on the kernel configuration.
        #
        # A reasonable value for this option is 60 seconds.

        # Master-Slave replication. Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of
        # another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
        #
        # 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
        #    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
        #    a given number of slaves.
        # 2) Redis slaves are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
        #    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
        #    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
        #    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
        # 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
        #    network partition slaves automatically try to reconnect to masters
        #    and resynchronize with them.
        #
        # slaveof <masterip> <masterport>

        # If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
        # directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before
        # starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
        # refuse the slave request.
        #
        # masterauth <master-password>

        # When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
        # is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:
        #
        # 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will
        #    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the
        #    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
        #
        # 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with
        #    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands
        #    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.
        #
        slave-serve-stale-data yes

        # You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
        # a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
        # written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
        # may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
        # misconfiguration.
        #
        # Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.
        #
        # Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients
        # on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.
        # Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands
        # such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve
        # security of read only slaves using 'rename-command' to shadow all the
        # administrative / dangerous commands.
        slave-read-only yes

        #
        # -------------------------------------------------------
        # WARNING: DISKLESS REPLICATION IS EXPERIMENTAL CURRENTLY
        # -------------------------------------------------------
        #
        # New slaves and reconnecting slaves that are not able to continue the replication
        # process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a "full
        # synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the slaves.
        # The transmission can happen in two different ways:
        #
        # 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB
        #                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent
        #                 process to the slaves incrementally.
        # 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the
        #              RDB file to slave sockets, without touching the disk at all.
        #
        # With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more slaves
        # can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing
        # the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once
        # the transfer starts, new slaves arriving will be queued and a new transfer
        # will start when the current one terminates.
        #
        # When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of
        # time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple slaves
        # will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.
        #
        # With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication
        # works better.
        repl-diskless-sync no

        # When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay
        # the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket
        # to the slaves.
        #
        # This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve
        # new slaves arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the server
        # waits a delay in order to let more slaves arrive.
        #
        # The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable
        # it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.

        # Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change
        # this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10
        # seconds.
        #
        # repl-ping-slave-period 10

        # The following option sets the replication timeout for:
        #
        # 1) Bulk transfer I/O during SYNC, from the point of view of slave.
        # 2) Master timeout from the point of view of slaves (data, pings).
        # 3) Slave timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).
        #
        # It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
        # specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected
        # every time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.
        #
        # repl-timeout 60

        # Disable TCP_NODELAY on the slave socket after SYNC?
        #
        # If you select "yes" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and
        # less bandwidth to send data to slaves. But this can add a delay for
        # the data to appear on the slave side, up to 40 milliseconds with
        # Linux kernels using a default configuration.
        #
        # If you select "no" the delay for data to appear on the slave side will
        # be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.
        #
        # By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions
        # or when the master and slaves are many hops away, turning this to "yes" may
        # be a good idea.
        repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no

        # Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates
        # slave data when slaves are disconnected for some time, so that when a slave
        # wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a partial
        # resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the slave missed while
        # disconnected.
        #
        # The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the slave can be
        # disconnected and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.
        #
        # The backlog is only allocated once there is at least a slave connected.
        #
        # repl-backlog-size 1mb

        # After a master has no longer connected slaves for some time, the backlog
        # will be freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that
        # need to elapse, starting from the time the last slave disconnected, for
        # the backlog buffer to be freed.
        #
        # A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.
        #
        # repl-backlog-ttl 3600

        # The slave priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.
        # It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a slave to promote into a
        # master if the master is no longer working correctly.
        #
        # A slave with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
        # for instance if there are three slaves with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will
        # pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
        #
        # However a special priority of 0 marks the slave as not able to perform the
        # role of master, so a slave with priority of 0 will never be selected by
        # Redis Sentinel for promotion.
        #
        # By default the priority is 100.
        slave-priority 100

        # It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
        # N slaves connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
        #
        # The N slaves need to be in "online" state.
        #
        # The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from
        # the last ping received from the slave, that is usually sent every second.
        #
        # This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
        # will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough slaves
        # are available, to the specified number of seconds.
        #
        # For example to require at least 3 slaves with a lag <= 10 seconds use:
        #
        # min-slaves-to-write 3
        # min-slaves-max-lag 10
        #
        # Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
        #
        # By default min-slaves-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
        # min-slaves-max-lag is set to 10.

        ################################### LIMITS ####################################

        # Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default
        # this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not
        # able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit
        # the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit
        # minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).
        #
        # Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending

        #
        # maxclients 10000

        # Don't use more memory than the specified amount of bytes.
        # When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys
        # according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).
        #
        # If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is
        # set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands
        # that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue
        # to reply to read-only commands like GET.
        #
        # This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU cache, or to set
        # a hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).
        #
        # WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on,
        # the size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted
        # from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will
        # not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output
        # buffer of slaves is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion
        # of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.
        #
        # In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower
        # limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for slave
        # output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
        #
        # maxmemory <bytes>

        # MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
        # is reached. You can select among five behaviors:
        #
        # volatile-lru -> remove the key with an expire set using an LRU algorithm
        # allkeys-lru -> remove any key according to the LRU algorithm
        # volatile-random -> remove a random key with an expire set
        # allkeys-random -> remove a random key, any key
        # volatile-ttl -> remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
        # noeviction -> don't expire at all, just return an error on write operations
        #
        # Note: with any of the above policies, Redis will return an error on write
        #       operations, when there are no suitable keys for eviction.
        #
        #       At the date of writing these commands are: set setnx setex append
        #       incr decr rpush lpush rpushx lpushx linsert lset rpoplpush sadd
        #       sinter sinterstore sunion sunionstore sdiff sdiffstore zadd zincrby

        #       getset mset msetnx exec sort
        #
        # The default is:
        #
        # maxmemory-policy noeviction

        # LRU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
        # algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or
        # accuracy. For default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was
        # used less recently, you can change the sample size using the following
        # configuration directive.
        #
        # The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely

        ############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################

        # By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
        # good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
        # a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
        # the configured save points).
        #
        # The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
        # much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
        # (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
        # dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
        # wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
        # still running correctly.
        #
        # AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
        # If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
        # with the better durability guarantees.
        #
        # Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.

        appendonly no

        # The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")

        appendfilename "appendonly.aof"

        # The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
        # instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
        # data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
        #
        # Redis supports three different modes:
        #
        # no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
        # always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
        # everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
        #
        # The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
        # speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
        # "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
        # it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
        # some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
        # or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
        # everysec.
        #
        # More details please check the following article:
        # http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
        #
        # If unsure, use "everysec".

        # appendfsync always
        appendfsync everysec
        # appendfsync no

        # When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
        # saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
        # performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations
        # Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
        # this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
        # our synchronous write(2) call.
        #
        # In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
        # that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
        # BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.

        # This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the

        # Normal Redis instances can't be part of a Redis Cluster; only nodes that are

        #

        # cluster-node-timeout 15000

        # A slave of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data
        # looks too old.
        #
        # There is no simple way for a slave to actually have a exact measure of
        # its "data age", so the following two checks are performed:
        #
        # 1) If there are multiple slaves able to failover, they exchange messages
        #    in order to try to give an advantage to the slave with the best
        #    replication offset (more data from the master processed).
        #    Slaves will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start
        #    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.
        #
        # 2) Every single slave computes the time of the last interaction with
        #    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master
        #    is still in the "connected" state), or the time that elapsed since the
        #    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).
        #    If the last interaction is too old, the slave will not try to failover
        #    at all.
        #
        # The point "2" can be tuned by user. Specifically a slave will not perform
        # the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time
        # elapsed is greater than:
        #
        #   (node-timeout * slave-validity-factor) + repl-ping-slave-period
        #
        # So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the slave-validity-factor
        # is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-slave-period of 10 seconds, the
        # slave will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master
        # for longer than 310 seconds.
        #
        # A large slave-validity-factor may allow slaves with too old data to failover
        # a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to
        # elect a slave at all.
        #
        # For maximum availability, it is possible to set the slave-validity-factor
        # to a value of 0, which means, that slaves will always try to failover the
        # master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.
        # (However they'll always try to apply a delay proportional to their
        # offset rank).

        # Zero is the only value able to guarantee that when all the partitions heal
        # the cluster will always be able to continue.

        # Cluster slaves are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters
        # that are left without working slaves. This improves the cluster ability
        # to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can't be failed over
        # in case of failure if it has no working slaves.
        #
        # Slaves migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a
        # given number of other working slaves for their old master. This number
        # is the "migration barrier". A migration barrier of 1 means that a slave
        # will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working slave for its master
        # and so forth. It usually reflects the number of slaves you want for every
        # master in your cluster.
        #
        # Default is 1 (slaves migrate only if their masters remain with at least
        # one slave). To disable migration just set it to a very large value.
        # A value of 0 can be set but is useful only for debugging and dangerous
        # in production.

        # By default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries if they detect there
        # is at least an hash slot uncovered (no available node is serving it).
        # This way if the cluster is partially down (for example a range of hash slots
        # are no longer covered) all the cluster becomes, eventually, unavailable.
        # It automatically returns available as soon as all the slots are covered again.
        #
        # However sometimes you want the subset of the cluster which is working,
        # to continue to accept queries for the part of the key space that is still
        # covered. In order to do so, just set the cluster-require-full-coverage

        ################################## SLOW LOG ###################################

        # The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
        # execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
        # like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
        # but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
        # stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
        # other requests in the meantime).
        #
        # You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis
        # what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
        # command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
        # slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
        # queue of logged commands.

        # The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
        # to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
        # a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
        slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

        # Via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user that can

        # latency-monitor-threshold configuration directive. When its value is set
        # to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.
        #
        # By default latency monitoring is disabled since it is mostly not needed
        # if you don't have latency issues, and collecting data has a performance
        # impact, that while very small, can be measured under big load. Latency

        ############################# EVENT NOTIFICATION ##############################

        # Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.
        # This feature is documented at http://redis.io/topics/notifications
        #
        # For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client
        # performs a DEL operation on key "foo" stored in the Database 0, two
        # messages will be published via Pub/Sub:
        #
        # PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del
        # PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo
        #
        # It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set
        # of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:
        #
        #  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@<db>__ prefix.
        #  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@<db>__ prefix.
        #  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...
        #  $     String commands
        #  l     List commands
        #  s     Set commands
        #  h     Hash commands
        #  z     Sorted set commands
        #  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)
        #  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)
        #  A     Alias for g$lshzxe, so that the "AKE" string means all the events.
        #
        #  The "notify-keyspace-events" takes as argument a string that is composed
        #  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications
        #  are disabled.
        #
        #  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the
        #           event name, use:
        #
        #  notify-keyspace-events Elg
        #
        #  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel
        #             name __keyevent@0__:expired use:
        #
        #  notify-keyspace-events Ex
        #
        #  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don't need
        #  this feature and the feature has some overhead. Note that if you don't
        #  specify at least one of K or E, no events will be delivered.

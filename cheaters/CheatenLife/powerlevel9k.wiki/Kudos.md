This theme wouldn't have happened without inspiration from the original
[agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) ZSH theme.

Before creating this theme, I also tried [jeremyFreeAgent's
theme](https://github.com/jeremyFreeAgent/oh-my-zsh-powerline-theme) and
[maverick2000's theme, ZSH2000](https://github.com/maverick2000/zsh2000).

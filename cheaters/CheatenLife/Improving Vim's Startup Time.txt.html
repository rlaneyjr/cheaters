  Improving Vim's Startup Time <http://usevim.com/2012/04/18/startuptime>

18 April 2012

Once you've installed pathogen.vim
<http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332> or Vundle
<http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3458>, installing Vim
scripts becomes almost... addictive. Eventually Vim's startup time may
start to suffer. Or perhaps you've installed a new OS and you can't work
out why Vim is loading slowly.

Fortunately, recent versions of Vim come with the |--startuptime|
command-line option:

$ vim --startuptime vim.log

This file should contain a heading and a list of timing messages:

times in msec
 clock   self+sourced   self:  sourced script
 clock   elapsed:              other lines

000.006  000.006: --- VIM STARTING ---
000.082  000.076: Allocated generic buffers
000.299  000.217: locale set
000.303  000.004: clipboard setup
000.308  000.005: window checked
000.787  000.479: inits 1
000.793  000.006: parsing arguments
000.793  000.000: expanding arguments
003.495  002.702: shell init
003.874  000.379: Termcap init
003.890  000.016: inits 2
003.996  000.106: init highlight
052.048  000.250  000.250: sourcing /usr/local/Cellar/vim/7.3.333/share/vim/vim73/syntax/syncolor.vim

The header is two lines and refers to each type of timing message. It's
easier to understand if it's broken down like this:

 clock   self+sourced   self:  sourced script
052.048  000.250  000.250: sourcing /usr/local/Cellar/vim/7.3.333/share/vim/vim73/syntax/syncolor.vim

 clock   elapsed:              other lines
000.006  000.006: --- VIM STARTING ---

What can we do with this? Well, let's try piping it through |sort -k 2|
to easily find the slowest sourced scripts:

$ cat vim.log | sort -k 2
387.346  100.634: loading plugins
169.582  145.276  005.804: sourcing /usr/local/Cellar/vim/7.3.333/share/vim/vim73/syntax/syntax.vim
230.845  206.734  039.239: sourcing $HOME/.vimrc

It's also worth launching Vim with different files so |--startuptime|
measures what happens when a particular file type is read.


      Slow Start

Typing |:help slow-start| shows Vim's built-in guidance on startup
performance -- it suggests checking if Vim was compiled with X11,
because loading shared libraries might be taking a noticeable amount of
time. Starting Vim with |-X| will prevent Vim from trying to connect to
an X server.

Loading the viminfo file can take a while too. Running Vim with |-i
NONE| will stop it from loading viminfo files.

It's also possible to load Vim without |~/.vimrc|. This can be useful
for determining if the problem is caused by your settings or the way Vim
was built on your system:

vim -u NONE --startuptime vim-NONE.log


      Profiling

Vim includes profiling tools that can be essential when debugging
scripts. This can be used from the command-line to measure how long each
function takes when Vim is started:

vim -c 'profile start vim.log' -c 'profile func *' -c 'q'

The |profile start| command expects a file name argument, and this file
will be truncated and written to with debugging information.

SQlite3 Part 3
############################################################
1. Each command ends with a semi-colon
2. There are 3 types of values
	a. String literals, which are characters surrounded almost always with single quotes
	b. Numeric literals, which are numbers of any type without quotes
	c. Binary literals are numbers represented as hexidecimals
	
3. There are 5 types in SQLite
	a. integer
	b. real
	c. text
	d. blob
	e. null
	
4. To use single quotes in a string add 2 in a row rather then one ''
5. Single line comments start with 2 lines --
6. Multiline comments start with /* and end with */
7. SQL is case insensitive
8. Each table can have only one primary key

select * // The action / verb
from general_power // The subject of your query
where power_type='Invulnerability'; // The predicate which describes the subject

CREATE TABLE origin_issue (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
comic_name TEXT NOT NULL COLLATE NOCASE,
issue_number INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
comic_issn INTEGER UNIQUE CHECK(comic_issn>0),
character_id integer,
FOREIGN KEY(character_id) REFERENCES identity(id));

// primary key means this will auto increment by 1 and remain unique
// NOT NULL means it can't contain a null value
// COLLATE NOCASE converts upper case characters to lowercase characters when comparing
// COLLATE BINARY if 2 strings are compared, they are compared using the exact characters
// COLLATE RTRIM compares just like BINARY except trailing white space is ignored
// DEFAULT defines a default value to use
// UNIQUE makes sure that the same number isn't used in this column
// CHECK sets a rule that all data in the column must obey
// A FOREIGN KEY in one table references a PRIMARY KEY in another table

// To add a column 
// It Can't be UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY
// It can't have a default value CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, // or an expression in parentheses
// If NOT NULL it can't have a NULL value

ALTER TABLE origin_issue
ADD COLUMN writer TEXT;

// You can rename a table

ALTER TABLE origin_issue RENAME TO first_issue;

SELECT 15 % 10;

// You can perform boolean operations in which 0 is false and any other number 
// is true

// <, <=, >, >=, =, ==, !=, <>

SELECT 1 < 2, 3 >= 2, 1 = 1, 1 <> 2;

// Other Operators

SELECT 'Super' || 'hero'; // String concatenation

SELECT 'Paul' IN ('Mike', 'Phil', 'Paul');

SELECT * FROM identity WHERE character IN ('Iron Man', 'Hulk');

// GLOB is like LIKE, but it is case sensitive and it uses the UNIX file 
// globbing syntax

// Find results that contain super, but not Super

GLOB '*super*';

// Find any match that has 9 characters

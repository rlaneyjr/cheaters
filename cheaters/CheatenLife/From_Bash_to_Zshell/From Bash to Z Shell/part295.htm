(This only happens if you start the job in the background—in other words, with an ampersand at the end of the command line.) In Unix jargon, this is referred to as a larger <i>nice value</i>, because the less the program hogs the computer, the more nice to you it’s being. If you want a background job to run at the normal priority—for example, because it’s running in another window and you need it to respond quickly—you can turn off the option <span class="s33">bg_nice</span>.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">bash <span class="p">doesn’t alter the priority of jobs started in the background. You need to use the external command </span>nice <span class="p">to reduce the priority of a command—just put it at the start of the command line. You can do this with foreground commands, too, and because it’s an external command it works with </span>zsh <span class="p">as well. There’s also a command </span>renice <span class="p">to increase the niceness of a command that is already running. (Only the root user can decrease the niceness of a running command.)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The following is an example of the <span class="s33">nice </span>command being used to lower the priority of a job run in the background. The command <span class="s33">make </span>is often used to compile software. For large software packages, this can be a long task and consume many system resources. Therefore, this is a good example of when reducing the priority is beneficial. As the command executes in the background, we also redirect both the standard output and standard error channels to a file:</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">% <b>nice make &gt;make.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part294.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../From Bash to Z Shell.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part296.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>

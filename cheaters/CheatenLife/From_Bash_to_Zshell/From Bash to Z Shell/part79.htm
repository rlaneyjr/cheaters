We show these with a space in between when there is a special key like one of the two above. For example <span class="s33">\M-xfoo </span>means press Meta x or Esc x, then type the ordinary characters <span class="s33">foo</span>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Few keyboards now have a key marked Meta. It is intended to be a modifier, just like Shift or Ctrl. On some PC keyboards the Alt key functions identically to the Meta key. You can combine modifiers; for example, \M-\C-x is given by holding down both the Meta and Ctrl keys, followed by the x key.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">bash and zsh have different approaches to key bindings with the \M- prefix. In bash, they are tied to the corresponding key bindings with Esc automatically. In zsh, however, the keys are actually different. There is no automatic link in zsh between what \M-x does and what Esc x does. You can force zsh to use equivalent bindings for both sets, so that, for example, pressing Meta x has the same effect as pressing Esc x. The following command has this effect on all the bindings that use the Esc key in emacs mode:</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Few keyboards now have a key marked Meta.

This is not just because that may be hard to set up, but more importantly because of how Meta works. It makes the terminal produce the same character but with the eighth bit set. This is not what you want if those characters are actually part of the character set you are using. In particular, it is no use at all if you are using the increasingly popular UTF-8 representation of characters, since the eighth bit has a special effect. So from now on we’ll assume you’re using the Esc key. However, we’ll still refer to bindings in the form \M-x for bash, since that’s how the bash documentation describes them. When we’re not showing the code you use for key binding we’ll say Esc x.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">zsh% <b>bindkey -me</b></p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For vi mode the equivalent command is the following:</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">zsh% <b>bindkey -mv</b></p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The extra -m has the effect of copying bindings for Esc x to those for Meta x.

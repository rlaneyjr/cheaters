This is a file, usually called <span class="s33">core</span>, in the program’s current directory. A debugger such as <span class="s33">gdb </span>or <span class="s33">dbx </span>can read the <span class="s33">core </span>file and tell you more about what the program was doing when it died. This is very handy for programmers. If, following a programming error, a program tries to do something bad such as access memory not allocated to it, the operating system makes it dump core. It is also possible to make a process dump core by sending it the <span class="s33">QUIT </span>signal. However, unless you actually want to debug the program, the <span class="s33">core </span>file is useless. These files also tend to be quite large so many people turn off core dumps. This can be done by limiting their size to 0:</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ulimit -c 0</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The only other sensible value is <span class="s33">unlimited</span>, which allows a full core dump. You can use this if you need to debug a program you are using, or if the maintainer of a program tells you they would like to see debugging information.</p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 269pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark573">CHAP TER 11 </a><span class="s28">■ </span>JO BS AND PROCESSES <span class="s27">273</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part305.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../From Bash to Z Shell.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part307.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>

If you do, opening a terminal window will probably retrieve either Konsole or</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">gnome-terminal<span class="p">, respectively. These behave pretty much like </span>xterm <span class="p">with a menu bar. Note that there’s nothing to stop you from using Konsole with Gnome or gnome-terminal with KDE.  You can start the one you want in the same fashion as opening an </span>xterm <span class="p">window, described earlier.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="504" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_098.png"/></span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">■<span class="s23">Tip </span><span class="s19">Old xterms don’t handle colors. Newer versions, and most alternatives, do. You will find colors are very useful with zsh’s completion listings to make different types of files stand out. The GNU ls command also supports colored file lists (try ls --color=auto).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="504" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_099.png"/></span></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark189"><span class="s27">74 </span></a>CHAPTER 4 <span class="s28">■ </span>EN TERING AND ED ITING THE CO MMAND LINE </p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We’ve summarized several key points concerning terminal emulators we’ve used in the past in the hopes that it will clear up some of the confusion as you begin your own experimen- tation. Keep in mind that the terminal emulator you choose is largely a matter of preference.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">• Plain old <span class="s33">xterm </span>doesn’t have menu buttons visible, but actually there are three menus that appear if you hold down the Ctrl key and then one of the mouse buttons. Two are quite useful. Holding Ctrl and clicking the middle mouse button gives you some options to change the look of the terminal, such as adding a scrollbar or turning on reverse video. Holding Ctrl and clicking the right mouse button lets you change the font to make it more (or less) readable. These also have command-line options, given in the <span class="s33">xterm </span>manual page.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Saving options for future <span class="s33">xterm </span>sessions is trickier than setting shell options, though. It’s done by the “X resources” mechanism, which is a bit out of the scope of this book. As an example, you can put the following lines in the file <span class="s33">~/.Xdefaults</span>. (Some systems use</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">~/.Xresources <span class="p">instead, and some systems allow either file.)</span></p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">! Change the font xterm*VT100*font: 10x20</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">! Turn on reverse video xterm*VT100*reverseVideo: true</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">On most systems, those lines may automatically set the font and reverse video option for <span class="s33">xterm </span>when your desktop starts up. You also may need to load the values in the file by hand, which is done by the following command:</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">% <b>xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults</b></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">(You will certainly need to do this to install the settings without logging in again.) Many traditional X Window programs like <span class="s33">xterm </span>will look for settings in this format in a file in your home directory. The name of the file is based on the program, for example <span class="s33">xterm</span>. (You can configure which directories are searched for such files by using the environ- ment variable <span class="s33">XUSERFILESEARCHPATH</span>. Type <span class="s33">man X </span>and search for this variable for more information.) This is on the computer where the program is running, not necessarily the computer where the display is. The command <span class="s33">xrdb </span>is known as the “X server resource database utility.” The <span class="s33">-merge </span>option tells <span class="s33">xrdb </span>not to remove existing resources. To find other things you can set in <span class="s33">~/.Xdefaults </span>in the same way, see the list of “RESOURCES” in the <span class="s33">xterm </span>manual page.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">• In the case of KDE’s Konsole, settings are done much more simply via obvious menus. Konsole has the additional feature that you can have multiple sessions (in other words, different shells, or even other programs) handled by the same Konsole. You create a new one from the New menu at the bottom, and can then switch between them by clicking on the appropriate name, or by using Shift-Left Arrow and Shift-Right Arrow. I tend to get confused and prefer to start separate windows. Needless to say, there are many other features. I have not yet successfully persuaded Konsole to accept a Meta key; see the sidebar “The Meta Key” (later in this chapter) for what that means.</p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 188pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark190">CHAPTER 4 </a><span class="s28">■ </span>EN TERING AND ED ITING THE CO MMAND LIN E <span class="s27">75</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">•   Gnome’s <span class="s33">gnome-terminal </span>behavior is fairly similar to KDE’s Konsole. Its version of the multiple-session feature is called “tabs,” because of the way you select them, as you do the tabs in newer versions of the Netscape and Mozilla web browsers; you create a new tab from the File menu. It also has “profiles,” which means you can store different groups of settings, for example different combinations of foreground and background colors, and switch between them by selecting a completely new profile instead of changing the options separately. You may find that the Alt or Meta key on your keyboard sometimes gets hijacked by <span class="s33">gnome-terminal </span>when you expect it to perform some editing task; you can fix this by going to the Edit menu, selecting Keybindings, and checking the option “Disable all menu mnemonics” (this is for <span class="s33">gnome-terminal </span>2.0.1; older versions may be different).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">• The third of the three most common Unix desktops—there are plenty of others—is the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). It’s found on many versions of Solaris, HP/UX, and AIX. If you ask for a terminal here, you’re likely to get <span class="s33">dtterm</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">• There’s a lightweight <span class="s33">xterm </span>look-alike called <span class="s33">rxvt</span>. Its main claim to fame is it has fewer features than <span class="s33">xterm</span>. This may seem more impressive if you know some of the really strange things <span class="s33">xterm </span>can do. It’s most likely to interest you if you have an old PC or work- station that strains to start terminal windows. Otherwise, it looks pretty similar.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">• The <span class="s33">aterm </span>terminal emulator is based on <span class="s33">rxvt</span>; it was designed for AfterStep, the desktop used by one of the authors, but like all the others it can be used with any desktop or window manager. One nice feature of <span class="s33">aterm </span>is the option <span class="s33">-tr </span>that makes it appear trans- parent, which actually means it copies the piece of the root window (wallpaper in Windows-speak) that is behind it into its own background.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Neither <span class="s33">rxvt </span>nor <span class="s33">aterm </span>provides menus. Note that both will pick up many of the values in <span class="s33">~/.Xdefaults </span>for <span class="s33">xterm</span>, but in that case you should remove the string <span class="s33">VT100* </span>from wherever it occurs in the example I showed earlier. It’s there because <span class="s33">xterm </span>has another, now very seldom used terminal emulator built into it that handles graphics, and I didn’t want to affect that, only the normal VT100 mode. VT100 is the name of an extremely widespread terminal of the 1980s made by DEC; <span class="s33">xterm </span>and its friends have borrowed many of the VT100’s features.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">• The Enlightened terminal, <span class="s33">Eterm</span>, is another enhanced <span class="s33">xterm</span>. It has a readable manual page and flashy backgrounds, and can be configured via configuration files, a fact that should make it appealing to those who are real shell programmers at heart.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">• Old SunOS/Solaris systems came with OpenWindows, which had <span class="s33">shelltool </span>and <span class="s33">commandtool </span>as the terminal emulators. If you are stuck with these you should go for <span class="s33">shelltool</span>, since <span class="s33">commandtool </span>swallows up the escape sequences that the editors in <span class="s33">bash </span>and <span class="s33">zsh </span>use for advanced editing. There’s an option for disabling <span class="s33">commandtool</span>’s special features, which essentially turns it into a shelltool. OpenWindows also provides genuine <span class="s33">xterm</span>, though on some really old versions it’s hidden in a demo directory. It’s unlikely to support color in any version of OpenWindows.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">There are various ways to connect to a Unix-style system from Windows. The most powerful is to get hold of one of the full X Window servers that essentially turn your PC into an X server. In addition to the commercial packages such as XWin-32 and eXceed, you can get an X Window</p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark191"><span class="s27">76 </span></a>CHAPTER 4 <span class="s28">■ </span>EN TERING AND ED ITING THE CO MMAND LINE </p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">server with Cygwin. We’ll discuss Cygwin in the section “Getting Started with Cygwin” in Chapter 5.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">If you don’t want all of that complexity, there is a useful program called <span class="s33">PuTTY </span>that connects via the <span class="s33">telnet </span>or <span class="s33">ssh </span>protocol, among others. The administrator of the machine you are logging into will be able to tell you which one you should use. When <span class="s33">PuTTY </span>is connected, it behaves exactly like a color <span class="s33">xterm</span>, and even indicates to the Unix system that it is an <span class="s33">xterm </span>by setting the environment variable <span class="s33">TERM </span>to <span class="s33">xterm</span>. The emulation is very good, and we recommend this over other solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part71.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../From Bash to Z Shell.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part73.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>

Armed with the knowledge picked up in this chapter, you are now in a position to remedy that situation yourself. By using shell functions to define completions, both <span class="s33">bash </span>and <span class="s33">zsh </span>allow you to make use of many of the features we described earlier in the book. The result is a very powerful mechanism for config- uring exactly how the shell handles completion for a particular command.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In this chapter, in addition to showing you how to generate completion matches, we have explained the many other features that are handled as part of the shells’, and particularly <span class="s33">zsh</span>’s, completion systems. We have shown you how to add descriptions to matches and group similar matches so that they can be listed together with a descriptive heading. We have demystified the tag loops system, which is behind the shell’s ability to group matches and control the order in which matches are completed. We have also explained the details of <span class="s33">zsh</span>’s <span class="s33">_arguments </span>function, enabling you to make use of its ability to complete command options, taking into account the many varying forms that command options take. Finally, we have shown that completion is not limited to your Tab key by demonstrating how different capabilities of the shell’s comple- tion system can be attached to another key.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part429.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../From Bash to Z Shell.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part431.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>

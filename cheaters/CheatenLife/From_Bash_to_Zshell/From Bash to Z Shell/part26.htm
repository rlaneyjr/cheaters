They’re giving you information as clearly as they can. Instead of trying to obscure the clues to the “mystery,” they’re laying them out in front of you. But even words spelled out clearly don’t always mean that a concept will be obvious at first.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">• <b>Put on your detective&#39;s cap: </b>If the puzzle doesn’t seem to be coming together, go back and see what the missing parts are. This can take some time and effort: learning some- thing new isn’t always easy! But, like reading a good mystery novel, finding the answer— putting the puzzle together—is well worth the time you spend.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">• <b>If something’s missing, find it: </b>Read each paragraph, or each group of a few paragraphs, then be sure the new concepts make sense before you go on. Sometimes they just won’t make sense; there might be a missing piece to the puzzle. If that happens, try going back and reviewing what you’ve read before.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">• <b>Check for understanding as you go: </b>Most sentences aren’t “fillers”; we’re trying to make a point, either to introduce a new idea or to tie some ideas together. For instance, after you’ve read a while and learned some new concepts, you might see a sentence like this:</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The  list  of  directories  comes  from  the  standard  output  of  tr.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">It’s best not to just say “Oh, umm-hmm” and keep reading. Instead, you should ask your- self a question like “On the basis of what I’ve read before, does that sentence make sense?” or “Do I agree with what the sentence says?” You could also ask yourself about each part of the sentence, like “What list?” or “What’s a directory?” or “What’s the standard output again?” or “What does <span class="s33">tr </span>do and why does it write to its standard output?” If you aren’t sure, don’t read too much more before you go back to hunt for the missing clues.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">• <b>Talk it over: </b>If you have some questions, and you have some computer-literate friends, talk it over with them. Discuss the problem—and, if you’d like to learn more than just the answer, discuss the topic in general. Explaining a problem to someone else, and being sure that each of you understands the other, is a great way to increase understanding.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">This is true even if your friends don’t know about shells. We’ll bet that they won’t only be impressed at what you’re doing. Soon your friends will be studying shells, too (and possibly asking <i>you </i>for advice!).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">• <b>Please experiment: </b>Experimenting on your system is a great way to learn and to check your understanding—if, that is, you’re careful about programs that could do damage— like <span class="s33">rm</span>, a program that removes files. For instance, as you read through a section, take some of the previous examples and change them slightly to see how that affects the results... then be sure you understand why.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s37" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">3</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">xxii          <span class="s28">■</span><span class="s29">PREFACE </span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We don’t assign formal exercises in this book, but you could come up with a practical problem and see how to handle it. As an example, after you’ve learned how to remove many files at once by using a wildcard, create a lot of dummy files and try to remove them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part25.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../From Bash to Z Shell.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part27.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>

Files under VIRL_STD_DIR
========================

The variable VIRL_STD_DIR (or --location in CLI) defines where all STD/UWM data
is stored. This directory must be writable by the user running both STD/UWM.
If this user is root (which is not necessary), all commands touching files from
this directory must be run as root as well, e.g. by using the sudo command.

The servers' working directory is configured by the VIRL_STD_DIR variable.
It contains the endpoints for all users, along with the VIRL files belonging to
sessions (simulations) running within the server, under the 'users' directory.

The server gets logged into the rotated files std_server.log or uwm_server.log
within the 'logs' directory. Verbose logging is enabled using the --debug flag
in front of each server's run command, and disabled entirely using --quiet.

Additionally, there is a subdirectory named 'archive/topologies', where a copy
of each successfully created session' VIRL file is stored for later reference.
These files are not removed automatically; end-users may remove them anytime.
This feature is generally disabled in VIRL installations.

Admin-submitted LXC templates and images reside Under the 'lxc' subdirectory.

Finally, all data pertaining to UWM and STD above the endpoint-stored is placed
into the servers.db file.

User workspace manager initialization and special user setup
============================================================

In general, the setup is managed by the VIRL installation system, and users
should not need to use these commands.

The UWM and STD servers operate over a shared database that is created
by the UWM init command. This command is dangerous, as it will destroy all
previous information in the database. Users should never need to run this.
The command must be given an existing OpenStack administrator account
information. The init command must be run prior to the STD server starting::

    virl_uwm_server init -u admin -p pass -U OSAdmin -T OSProject -P OSPass

This user can then use the UWM Web-based GUI to add additional projects.
These projects will have all the networking set up as expected by STD.

To add an existing project and user (admin or not), use the following::

    virl_uwm_server add-user -u user -p pass -U OSUser -T OSProject -P OSPass

Any user's password and OpenStack passwords can be changed from the CLI. If
an OpenStack password is not specified, it will be computed as a hash of the
STD/UWM password.

To change user passwords from the server, use::

    virl_uwm_server set-password -u user -p pass -P OSPass

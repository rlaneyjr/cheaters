Introduction

Virtual Internet Routing Lab is a stack of Cisco technologies for authoring,
running and management of virtual topologies of networked routers and servers.

This document describes version 0.10.17.7 of the Service Topology Director and
the User Workspace Management, comprising the VIRL-CORE backend package.

This package includes an OpenStack client for communication with OpenStack
virtual machine orchestration installations, a low-level interface containing
the core functionality, a topology library for handling of VIRL topology files,
a plugin system to externalize VM-specific functionality into separate modules
and a pair of WSGI (web service) servers, one for remote management of virtual
network topologies, and another for the management of projects, users and other
resources, both within each of the VIRL servers and the OpenStack installation.

OpenStack Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenStack client is an API that VIRL uses exclusively when communicating
with an OpenStack install. It covers required portions of the OpenStack
identity, compute, image and network API. The CLI script virl_openstack_client
exposes all supported commands to shell scripting.

Using the CLI - upload a new image to OpenStack
===============================================

You can add new router and server images to the OpenStack install easily.
This is especially true for very large image files.
Prepare the VM image in the QCOW2 format - kvm-img can be used for conversions.

Please note that VIRL selects the image based on name only, and OpenStack
allows multiple images with the same name to be present at once. Image creation
does not replace an existing image of the same name, thus the previous version
needs to be removed in order to ensure the correct image is loaded.

As discussed above in the introduction, Cisco router images need properties
set in order to function properly, so they must be provided as well.

For example, to add a new CSR1000v image, this command may be used::

    virl_openstack_client --json image-create --access private \
        --file CSR1000v.myversion.qcow2 --name myproject-CSR1000v-mine \
        --properties serial=2 config_disk_type=cdrom \
        hw_disk_bus=virtio hw_vif_model=virtio hw_cdrom_bus=ide

The output on success is the parsed image information as returned by OpenStack.
The global --json flag will convert the retrieved data back into JSON before
being output to stdout, enabling further automated processing of this data.

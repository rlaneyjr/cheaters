Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case the VIRL system does not work, the virl_health_status script may be
of some help in determining if some system-level error is preventing VIRL
or OpenStack services from working properly.

To create a basic status report using this command, use the following::

   sudo virl_health_status | tee status_report.txt

The STD and or UWM log may help troubleshooting if the problem exists on this
layer. If the problem is a result of an internal error response from OpenStack,
the logs of the affected OpenStack services (or syslog) should contain error
information commonly not propagated to service consumers, such as VIRL.

The logs for the VIRL-CORE servers are located at::

    ls -l /var/local/virl/logs/

The logs for openstack services are located under these directories::

    ls -l /var/log/{keystone,nova,neutron,glance,cinder}

VIRL-CLIENTS package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The VIRL-CLIENTS contains the following programs:

virl_openstack_client
  Thin interface to the OpenStack client API, not needed by the typical user

virl_std_client
  Allows the control of the functionality available to the GUI application
  even from the command line; this is the designated tool for automation
  and the only script a typical VIRL end-user might want to use

virl_uwm_client
  Provides a programmable CLI interface covering the functionality that is
  available to the user of the UWM rest interface, a subset of the available
  web interface that isn't better covered by the STD API.

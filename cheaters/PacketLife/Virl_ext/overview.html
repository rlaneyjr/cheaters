<h1>2. Terminology and Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#terminology-and-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The chief aim of the VIRL system is simulating virtual network topologies using
network nodes run as virtual machines inside an OpenStack VM orchestration
platform. To this end, each user of the VIRL services is bound to a single
OpenStack user within an OpenStack project(tenant). This and other information
pertaining to a user capable of running simulation is called that user’s
endpoint. Some users, notably uwmadmin, do no posess an endpoint, and can only
be used for administrative and status-gathering tasks on the system.</p>
<p>In each endpoint, several Sessions may be created. Each session represents one
network topology deployed to the orchestration system. It has a unique name and
is configured by a single VIRL file. This file is sourced on various occasions
and cannot be changed nor removed while the given session is defined.</p>
<p>A VIRL file contains all information pertaining to the active networking nodes
within it, the connections between them, as well as connections to the
outside of the simulated environment. Moreover, the initial configuration that
is to be passed onto each node when it is started (i.e. deployed to OpenStack),
and any other information associated with the topology can be stored
as extension entries available for all major elements of the file.</p>
<p>The session creation process makes some initial validations against the running
OpenStack system, but does not start the topology, meaning no resources are
deployed to the OpenStack system initially. Session nodes must be started, and
can be stopped, individually. The start operation will deploy the necessary
OpenStack networks, ports, and the VM nodes requested to be started. A stop
operation will destroy the deployed resources, including networks that are no
longer needed.</p>
<p>A session may be exported to a new VIRL file, possibly along with downloaded
router configurations for all or selected nodes. Finally, a session delete will
stop and then remove all traces of a session, both in OpenStack and endpoint.</p>
<p>The OpenStack client API and CLI covers all communication used by the VIRL-CORE
package. It may be useful for direct interaction with, and troubleshooting of,
OpenStack, replacing the various clients distributed alongside OpenStack for
an arguably more consistent interface.</p>
<p>A pair of Web servers provides an API for remote management of a set of
endpoints, one for each end-user. They provide all the functionality a typical
VIRL user might need, leaving the OpenStack CLIs for use only
in special circumstances.</p>
<p>The STD server (Service Topology Director) defines simple and straightforward
workflow for session (simulation) launch, use and teardown, either through
the GUI application, or using the provided STD client Python API and/or CLI.
A launched simulation is scheduled to start all nodes not excluded from this
by a flag settable for each individual node, just after the session creation.</p>
<p>The node start and stop operations are performed separately from the calls
to the web service that initiate them. Moreover, a node may take a while to
become provisioned by the orchestration sytem (i.e. the node becomes ACTIVE),
which may merely mean that the particular node started its internal booting,
initialization and configuration process.</p>
<p>The UWM server can be used by administrators for project and user management,
as well as management of VM disk images and other resources consumed by user
simulations.</p>
<p>An interface for the management of software licenses, VIRL software upgrades,
and a control panel for manipulation of system configuration and deployment
is also available in this admin interface.</p>
<p>UWM also presents a general overview and allows for interaction with running
simulations of all users. A statistics display, health status check and log
message collection can be performed as well.</p>
<p>Individual users may use UWM to maintain their own simulations, including
launching new simulation using imported VIRL files. To aid with VIRL file
management, external git repositories may be attached to each user, allowing
the previewing, as well as launching of simulations defined by these files.</p>

<h2>2.1. CLI Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#cli-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Contained within the VIRL-CORE package are the following programs:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>virl_openstack_client</dt>
<dd>Thin interface to the OpenStack client API, not needed by the typical user</dd>
<dt>virl_std_server</dt>
<dd>Simulation server exposing remote management of a set of VIRL endpoints
for use by the Graphical User Interface application</dd>
<dt>virl_std_client</dt>
<dd>Allows the control of the functionality available to the GUI application
even from the command line; this is the designated tool for automation
and the only script a typical VIRL end-user might want to use</dd>
<dt>virl_uwm_server</dt>
<dd>A web-based project, user, image, and flavor management application,
controlling access to and retrieving information on the state of the STD
server</dd>
<dt>virl_uwm_client</dt>
<dd>Provides a programmable CLI interface covering the functionality that is
available to the user of the UWM rest interface, a subset of the available
web interface that isn’t better covered by the STD API.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each program can display help on its subcommands using:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>virl_program_name <span class="o">[</span>subcommand<span class="o">]</span> -h
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each command has a set of script-global options, and is divided up into several
subcommands with their own options. The global options precede the subcommand.</p>
<p>Each program also has a –debug mode (the option is script-global)
that enables (very) verbose logging and full reporting in case of a failure.
Some logging is enabled by default, controlled by configuration; the –quiet
flag can be used to supress all logging.</p>
<p>An other program included with the package, virl_webmuxd, is another server
facilitating SSH-based terminal connections into simulation nodes. In a typical
VIRL deployment, this service is launched together with the uwm_server.</p>

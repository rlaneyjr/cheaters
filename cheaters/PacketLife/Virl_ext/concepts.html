<h1>4. Projects, Users and Special Networks<a class="headerlink" href="#projects-users-and-special-networks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The OpenStack, users are grouped into and share resources within projects,
also known as tenants. In VIRL, each user is expected to belong to exactly one
project. Typically, each user has a project of its own, named after the user.</p>
<p>Each user has a password and a set of roles within the project. Only
two roles are of any importance to VIRL: automatic _member_, and admin. Admin
users may use the full range of OpenStack identity operations that are usually
denied to normal users. Admins may also alter quotas on projects, modify and
delete all resources associated with any other project. Users should commonly
not be declared admins.</p>
<p>One exception is users wishing to define static IP addressing on the shared
external networks - the default policy in OpenStack neutron restricts such
an operation to admin users. The UWM Connectivity tab allows an admin to pre-
create ports to bind to on the external networks for non-admin users, if they
are not to be made admins themselves.</p>
<p>At least one admin user, typically named uwmadmin, is required for correct
operation of both servers. This user is selected for operations concerning
project and user management in UWM, as well as OpenStack status retrieval
in both servers.</p>
<p>Each simulated topology selects a single network to be used for management
purposes. The management interface of each VM node, unless one is disabled
for that node’s subtype, will be connected to this network.</p>
<p>In VIRL, each project has one default management network, named the same as
the project owning it. This network is used by all simulations that do not
select a different network to connect to. This is also called the project
management network. The other options are to create an “exclusive” network,
with the simulation management separated from every other network, and “flat”,
where the flat network described below gets used.</p>
<p>There is also another special network, named by appending “_snat” to the name
of the project. Both this network and the project management network are routed
to a shared network named ext-net, which implements L3 (S)NAT functionality.
Both the management and the snat networks have a gateway, where packets sent-to
get translated to an address on the ext-net network. For management, the same
translated IP address is used for all nodes. For the snat network, used by SNAT
connections in the topology, a floating IP address will be assigned from a pool
on the ext-net network and mapped to the internal IP address on snat network.</p>
<p>In current VIRL installations, there is another pair of shared flat networks,
implementing the L2 FLAT external network connections, named “flat” and “flat1”
in OpenStack. Each topology node may connect one interface to each of these
networks. Alternatively, a topology may globally switch the management network
over to flat, in which case each node’s first (and no other) interface will
get connectivity to the virtualization host server and beyond.</p>
<p>Additional flat networks may be configured in OpenStack, leaving an option for
connecting each node to multiple outside networks. Each new L2 FLAT network
requires an additional bridge/port on the VIRL host, permanent configuration of
the neutron (networking) server, as well as defining a FLAT provider network.
The addition of more L2 FLAT networks is not supported by the installation
and configuration system used by the VIRL project.</p>
<p>Note that the ext-net network used for SNAT is also technically created as
a flat provider network, but only floating IP ports are allowed to be created
on this network, hence it can only be used with SNAT connectors.</p>
<p>Both the flat networks, and ext-net, use a separate physical interface of the
VIRL (OpenStack compute) host to forward traffic into and outside of the host.
The VIRL host itself has an IP address assigned in each of these networks,
making it possible for simulations to communicate with their host. A gateway
IP address can be set to each of these networks, typically on a router outside
the VIRL host connected to the physical interface. Alternatively, the gateway
may be set to the VIRL host’s IP address, reusing its own routing setup.</p>
<div class="section" id="virl-files">
<h2>4.1. VIRL files<a class="headerlink" href="#virl-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>VIRL file is an XML-based format for encoding networked VM topologies. Several
revisions of this file format are supported. However, it is recommended to
author all new topologies to conform to the latest version, 0.9.</p>
<p>Each revision is defined by an XML schema definition file. The latest revision
can be obtained internally at <a class="reference external" href="http://cide.cisco.com/vmmaestro/schema/virl.xsd">http://cide.cisco.com/vmmaestro/schema/virl.xsd</a>,
and externally at <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.github.com/CiscoVIRL/schema/v0.9/virl.xsd">https://raw.github.com/CiscoVIRL/schema/v0.9/virl.xsd</a>.</p>
<p>Each VIRL file consists of these elements (supported by this implementation):</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>topology</dt>
<dd>Root element of the topology. Contains groups, nodes and connections.</dd>
<dt>group</dt>
<dd>Named group of nested groups and nodes. Used to logically group node sets.
Each group and node must define a name such that the list of names from the
root topology to each node is unique within a document. A name should not
contain the substring “::”, as it is used as the separator for the name list
when referring to nodes by their names.</dd>
<dt>node type=”SIMPLE”</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Virtual machine node. It defines interfaces connected to other nodes.
Each node must specify a subtype defining the platform the node will run,
and also may specify an OpenStack image and/or flavor (hw parameters).
Both image and flavor default to the same string value as the node subtype.</p>
<p class="last">Additionally, a disk volume may be assigned to a node for exclusive use.
A node will not be automatically started on simulation launch if the value
of the ‘excludeFromLaunch’ boolean attribute is set to ‘true’.</p>
</dd>
<dt>node type=”SIMPLE” subtype=”unmanaged_switch”</dt>
<dd>A newer representation on a multi-point connection. The image and other
attributes of the node required for VMs are ignored. This node, and any
other unmanaged switch or SEGMENT, represent a single OpenStack network,
where multiple nodes may connect at the same time (at most once), as opposed
to simple point-to-point connections.</dd>
<dt>node type=”SEGMENT” (deprecated)</dt>
<dd>A multi-point connection. This node defines no interfaces. Any SIMPLE nodes
may be connected directly with this node. A SEGMENT may connect to another,
both segments comprising a single logical network. An unconnected SEGMENT is
ignored. This node type is deprecated in favor of the unmanaged_switch node.</dd>
<dt>node type=”ASSET”</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A node reserved for actual hardware. Currently used for connecting nodes to
external networks, determined by value of its subtype attribute. Each outside
network node has a single interface that may be connected to a single SIMPLE
node’s interface. An unconnected external network asset is ignored.</p>
<p>For subtype=”FLAT”, the SIMPLE node’s connected interface will be placed into
a special pre-created flat provider network, that must have a defined subnet.
This denotes the L2 FLAT external network connection mechanism.</p>
<p>For subtype=”SNAT”, the SIMPLE node’s connected interface will be placed into
a special pre-created network named “&lt;project&gt;_snat”, that must have a subnet
defined. A floating IP address on a special pre-created network named ext-net
will be made available to this interface as well, with SNAT routing provided
between these two networks.
This denotes the L3 SNAT external network connection mechanism.</p>
<p>All special and predefined networks are created and configured by the VIRL
standalone installation process (that also installs OpenStack and other
software), the details of which are outside the scope for this documentation.
The networks specific to any new project are automatically configured by UWM.</p>
<p>For subtype=”EXT-ROUTER”, the node connected is not a SIMPLE node, but a FLAT
ASSET node. This node may carry configuration options that present the SIMPLE
node connected via the FLAT mediator that an external router exists outside
of the simulation. This node merely carries information for the AutoNetkit
configuration engine and is effectively ignored by the LLI and STD.</p>
<p>For subtype=”DUMMY”, the node will be ignored completely, but may be drawn
into the topology to indicate nodes which are not to be simulated.</p>
<p class="last">No other ASSET subtypes are defined and will be rejected by VIRL.</p>
</dd>
<dt>interface</dt>
<dd><p class="first">An interface is defined for SIMPLE and ASSET nodes. Each interface must have
a name specific to the node subtype and a matching 0-based integral id.</p>
<p>ASSET nodes use names “link&lt;id&gt;”, e.g. “link0”. A FLAT or SNAT node must have
exactly one interface linking it to a SIMPLE node except an unmanaged switch.
The EXT-ROUTER ASSET node must link to a FLAT node.</p>
<p>There may be gaps in the names of defined interfaces, and interfaces need not
be connected to anything. However, a network will still be generated for each
interface in the sequence of interface id’s from 0 to the largest defined in
the node due technical details of VM instance creation.</p>
<p class="last">Each SIMPLE subtype also contains an implicit management interface, which
is always the first interface in a given instance and is not defined in the
VIRL file itself. Note that e.g. IOSv uses GigabitEthernet0/0 for management,
thus it cannot be used for connections within a topology. Management network
containing all these interfaces is either an exclusive simulation network
created and configured by STD for each simulation, or a project management
or a flat network, either of which must be pre-created and contain a single
OpenStack subnet with DHCP enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt>connection</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A connection denotes a link between two elements. Permitted connections are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>between two SIMPLE node interfaces for a point-to-point network</li>
<li>between a SIMPLE node and an unmanaged switch interfaces for multi-point</li>
<li>between any two unmanaged switches’ interfaces to merge them</li>
<li>between a SIMPLE node interface and an ASSET FLAT/SNAT external interface</li>
<li>between interfaces of an EXT-ROUTER and a FLAT ASSET node</li>
<li>between a SIMPLE node interface and a SEGMENT multi-point connection node</li>
<li>between two SEGMENT nodes to merge them into a single logical SEGMENT node</li>
</ul>
<p>SEGMENT nodes are deprecated in favor of unmanaged switched.</p>
<p>No node may be connected to the same network twice. This means a node cannot
have two SNAT connections, nor two FLAT connections to the same network, nor
can the management network use the same FLAT network as a FLAT ASSET node,
not connect to the same unmanaged switch, even if composed of multiple nodes,
and no node may connect to itself.</p>
<p class="last">The connection endpoints are defined using interchangeable “src” and “dst”
attributes holding an XPath expression resolving to a single node’s interface
or a single SEGMENT node. The element namespace prefix “virl:” shall be used
in all XPath expressions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>extensions</dt>
<dd>A container for 0 or more entry elements. May be placed first in a topology,
group, node, interface or connection element. Note that there should be no
extensions elements without any entry defined. This relaxation of the XSD
as published is a VIRL-CORE extension: empty extensions will be accepted by
the Topology loader, but they will be removed from serialized output for
compatibility with other VIRL file format consumers.</dd>
<dt>entry</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Container for arbitrary extension data. It has attributes “key” and “type”,
where type is usually “String”. Its text content is the entry value.
Most entries are used by the AutoNetkit-based configuration generator engine.
The entry keys recognized by STD/LLI are described in the next subsections.</p>
<p class="last">Every extension entry key may be optionally prefixed by literal “AutoNetkit.”
- this entry will only be used by LLI if the non-prefixed entry is missing.
Some tools may insert that prefix even to extension entries that aren’t
actually used by the AutoNetkit configuration engine at all.
Other software need not replicate this behavior, using only the entry with
or without this prefix.</p>

management network is used. It is a network created for each project. Both
values have the same meaning; in practice, most projects contain a single
user bearing the same name.</p>
<p>The special value “exclusive” determines that a new network is to be created
for the management of this simulation; its subnet can be defined by another
extension, or a configured default will be used.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the network named in this fashion must be accessible to the
OpenStack user launching the session, either by being a shared network,

runs an SSH server, where the user can log in using the same credentials
as in the STD/UWM server.</p>
<p>This node is connected to the simulation’s management network with one
interface, and to the flat network with another. It can serve as a bridge
between the outside world and the simulation’s management network, notably
when using the per-simulation management network.</p>
<p class="last">If this value is set to False, and the simulation is not using per-simulation
network, the STD will maintain a separate simulation as long as any such

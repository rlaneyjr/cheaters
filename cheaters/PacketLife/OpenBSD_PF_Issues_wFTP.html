<h2 id="modes">FTP modes</h2>

FTP is a protocol that dates back to when the internet was a small,
friendly collection of computers and everyone knew everyone else.
At that time, the need for filtering or tight security wasn't necessary.
FTP wasn't designed for filtering, for passing through firewalls, or for
working with NAT.

<p>
You can use FTP in one of two ways: passive or active.
Generally, the choice of active or passive is made to determine who has the
problem with firewalling.
Realistically, you will have to support both to have happy users.

<p>
With active FTP, when a user connects to a remote FTP server and requests
information or a file, the FTP server makes a new connection back to the
client to transfer the requested data.
This is called the <i>data connection</i>.
To start, the FTP client chooses a random port to receive the data connection.
The client sends the port number it chose to the FTP server and listens for
an incoming connection on that port.
The FTP server then initiates a connection to the client's address at the
chosen port and transfers the data.
This is a problem for users attempting to gain access to FTP servers from
behind a NAT gateway.
Because of how NAT works, the FTP server initiates the data connection by
connecting to the external address of the NAT gateway on the chosen port.
The NAT machine will receive this, but because it has no mapping for the
packet in its state table, it will drop the packet and won't deliver it to
the client.

<p>
With passive mode FTP (the default mode with OpenBSD's
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ftp">ftp(1)</a> client), the client requests
that the server pick a random port to listen on for the data connection.
The server informs the client of the port it has chosen, and the client
connects to this port to transfer the data.
Unfortunately, this is not always possible or desirable because of the
possibility of a firewall in front of the FTP server blocking the incoming
data connection.
OpenBSD's ftp(1) uses passive mode by default.
To force active mode FTP, use the <tt>-A</tt> flag to <tt>ftp</tt>, or set
passive mode to "off" by issuing the command "<tt>passive off</tt>" at the
"<tt>ftp&gt;</tt>" prompt.

<h2 id="client">FTP client behind the firewall</h2>

As indicated earlier, FTP does not go through NAT and firewalls very well.

<p>
Packet Filter provides a solution for this situation by diverting FTP traffic
through an FTP proxy server.
This process acts to "guide" your FTP traffic through the NAT gateway/firewall,
by actively adding needed rules to PF system and removing them when done, by
means of the PF <a href="anchors.html">anchors</a> system.
The FTP proxy used by PF is
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ftp-proxy">ftp-proxy(8)</a>.

<p>
To activate it, put something like this early in the rules section
of <tt>pf.conf</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
pass in quick on $int_if inet proto tcp to port 21 divert-to 127.0.0.1 port 8021
</pre></blockquote>

This diverts FTP from your clients to the ftp-proxy(8) program, which is
listening on your machine to port 8021.

<p>
You also need an anchor in the rules section:

<blockquote><pre>
anchor "ftp-proxy/*"
</pre></blockquote>

The proxy server has to be started and running on the OpenBSD box.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl enable ftpproxy</b>
# <b>rcctl start  ftpproxy</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The ftp-proxy utility listens on port 8021, the same port the above
<tt>divert-to</tt> statement is sending FTP traffic to.

<p>
To support active mode connections from certain (fussy) clients,
you may need the <tt>-r</tt> switch on ftp-proxy(8).

<h2 id="server">PF "self-protecting" an FTP server</h2>

In this case, PF is running on the FTP server itself rather than a dedicated
firewall computer.
When servicing a passive FTP connection, FTP will use a randomly chosen, high
TCP port for incoming data.
By default, OpenBSD's native <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ftpd">ftpd(8)</a>
uses the range 49152 to 65535.
Obviously, these must be passed through the filter rules, along with port 21
(the FTP control port):

<blockquote><pre>
pass in on egress proto tcp to port 21
pass in on egress proto tcp to port &gt; 49151
</pre></blockquote>

You can tighten up that range of ports considerably if you want to.
In the case of <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ftpd">ftpd(8)</a>, that is
done using the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sysctl">sysctl(8)</a> variables
<tt>net.inet.ip.porthifirst</tt> and <tt>net.inet.ip.porthilast</tt>.

<h2 id="natserver">FTP server protected by an external PF firewall running
NAT</h2>

In this case, the firewall must redirect traffic to the FTP server in addition
to not blocking the required ports.
In order to accomplish this, we turn again to ftp-proxy(8).

<p>
ftp-proxy(8) can be run in a mode that causes it to forward all FTP connections
to a specific FTP server.
Basically, we'll set up the proxy to listen on port 21 of the firewall and
forward all connections to the backend server.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl set ftpproxy flags -R 10.10.10.1 -p 21 -b 192.168.0.1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Here 10.10.10.1 is the IP address of the actual FTP server, 21 is the
port we want ftp-proxy(8) to listen on, and 192.168.0.1 is the address
on the firewall that we want the proxy to bind to.

<p>
Now for the pf.conf rules:

<blockquote><pre>
ext_ip = "192.168.0.1"
ftp_ip = "10.10.10.1"
match out on egress inet from $int_if nat-to (egress)
anchor "ftp-proxy/*"
pass in  on  egress inet proto tcp to $ext_ip port 21
pass out on $int_if inet proto tcp to $ftp_ip port 21 user _ftp_proxy
</pre></blockquote>

Here we allow the connection inbound to port 21 on the external interface,
as well as the corresponding outbound connection to the FTP server.
The "user _ftp_proxy" addition to the outbound rule ensures that only
connections initiated by ftp-proxy(8) are permitted.

<p>
Note that if you want to run ftp-proxy(8) to protect an FTP server as well
as allow clients to FTP out from behind the firewall, two instances of
ftp-proxy will be required.

<h2 id="info">More information on FTP</h2>

More information on filtering FTP and how FTP works in general can be
found in this whitepaper:

      Reviewed</a>
</ul>

<h2 id="tftp-proxy">Proxying TFTP</h2>

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) suffers from some of the same
limitations as FTP does when it comes to passing through a firewall.
Luckily, PF has a helper proxy for TFTP called
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/tftp-proxy">tftp-proxy(8)</a>.

<p>
tftp-proxy(8) is setup in much the same way as ftp-proxy(8) was in
the <a href="#client">FTP client behind the firewall</a> section above.

<blockquote><pre>
match out on egress inet from $int_if nat-to (egress)
anchor "tftp-proxy/*"
pass in quick on $int_if inet proto udp from $int_if to port tftp \
    divert-to 127.0.0.1 port 6969
anchor "tftp-proxy/*"
</pre></blockquote>

The rules above allow TFTP outbound from the internal network to TFTP
servers on the external network.

<p>
The last step is to enable tftp-proxy in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/inetd.conf">inetd.conf(5)</a> so that it
listens on the same port that the <tt>divert-to</tt> rule specified above,
in this case 6969.

<blockquote><pre>
127.0.0.1:6969  dgram   udp   wait  root  /usr/libexec/tftp-proxy tftp-proxy
</pre></blockquote>

Unlike ftp-proxy(8), tftp-proxy(8) is spawned from inetd.

<h1 class="heading1">Quality of Service</h1>
<hr>
</center>

<br>

<h2 class="heading2">1. Overview</h2>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">1.1 Introduction</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Quality of Service (QoS) is where the data traffic on a network be it a LAN or a WAN,
is subject to scrutiny and control.  Quality of Service is primarily an IP concept and uses tools that have existed
since the early days of IP plus newer tools and protocols that are designed to aid the provision of defined 
predictable data transfer characteristics.  Quality of Service is also relevant at layer 2 within the
Ethernet environment and also within the WAN technologies such as Frame Relay and ATM.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
The drive for QoS has become very strong in recent years because there has been a growth of multimedia traffic
such as voice and video, that mixes it with more traditional data traffic such as FTP, Telnet and SMB.  Applications
such as Voice over IP and Microsoft's Netmeeting have opened up the possibility of more interactive communications
between users not just over the LAN but also over the WAN.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">1.2 Sensitive Traffic</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Much data traffic has been very tolerant of delays and packet drops, however voice traffic has different characteristics.
Voice is low volume but is intolerant of jitter (delay) and packet loss.  Video is also intolerant of jitter and packet
loss, plus it has the added complication of being very bursty at times.  This convergence of multimedia traffic with
traditional data traffic is set to grow and therefore requires methods and tools to ensure that providers can
deliver networks that give the users confidence to use these tools effectively.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">1.3 Where QoS is Applied</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
You can often get away with introducing high bandwidth multimedia applications to a data network that
has a well designed core and access topology, particularly if the core is based on Gigabit Ethernet
technology and the access switches are not over-subscribed with respect to the backbone links.  Even in
this scenario there is the issue of speed mismatches between technologies such as Gigabit Ethernet
and Fast Ethernet.  This requires buffering and therefore leads to a requirement to queue and prioritise
traffic.  Layer 2 switches can mark frames using <b>Class of Service (CoS)</b> marking if end devices
do not mark the frames themselves.  These frames can then be assigned to hardware queues that
exist on modern layer 2 switches.  Often the concept of <b>Trust Boundaries</b> is used to describe
how far out to the endpoints a switch will trust the marking of a frame.   
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
The most significant network bottlenecks exist at the Remote Access points, the WAN access, Internet
access and the servers.  Once a packet is on the core of the network, it generally deserves to be there,
providing that your security is intact.  Many of the technologies involved in QoS are to do with how
packets are dealt with as they enter and leave a network because merely adding more bandwidth at the
edge is only a short term solution that just resolves capacity and perhaps some congestion problems.
Adding bandwidth does not resolve jitter or add any traffic prioritisation features.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">1.4 Reasons for QoS</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Problems faced when attempting to provide QoS include:
</div>

<ul>
<li>A shortage of bandwidth because network links are oversubscribed.</li>
<li>Packets being lost due to congestion at bursty periods.  Modern DSPs can fill in for between
20ms to 50ms of lost voice.</li>
<li>End-to-End delay made up by a number of components that occur in the following order:
	<ol>
	<li>Fixed <b>Switch Delay</b> - as packets are layer 2 switched from the call initiator.</li>
	<li>Fixed <b>Encoding Delay</b> - coding PCM to G.729 (5 ms look ahead then 10ms per frame,
	with G.729 a Frame Relay packet would typically have 2 x 10ms samples),
	G.726 (0.125us), G.723 (30ms), G.728 (2.5ms) etc.</li>
	<li>Fixed <b>Voice Activity Detection (VAD)</b> - around 5ms. </li>
	<li>Fixed <b>Packetisation Delay</b> - i.e. packetising samples in G.711, G.726, G.729 etc.</li>
	<li>Variable <b>Output Queuing Delay</b> - as voice packets enter an output queue and wait for the
	preceding frame (voice or data)	to be played out.</li>
	<li>Fixed <b>Serialisation Delay</b> - the time it takes to get the bits on to the circuit.
	The faster the circuit and the smaller the packet, the less this delay.</li>
	<li>Fixed <b>Processing Delay</b> - the time it takes for the packets to be examined, routed, managed etc.</li>
	<li>Variable <b>Network Queuing Delay</b> - due to clocking frames in and out of the different
	network switches.</li>
	<li>Fixed <b>Network Propagation Delay</b> - normally assumed to be 6 microseconds/km or
	10 microseconds/mile (G.114) as the packets traverse the medium.  Across the UK this is
	typically between 1ms and 3ms.</li>
	<li>Variable <b>Input Queuing Delay</b> - as voice packets enter an input queue and wait for the
	preceding frame (voice or data)	to be played out.</li>
	<li>Fixed <b>Dejitter Buffer Delay</b> - can be up to 50ms.</li>
	<li>Fixed <b>Switch Delay</b> - as packets are layer 2 switched to the endpoint.</li>
	<li>Fixed <b>Decoding Delay</b> - decoding the compressed packets is trivial compared to encoding
	and so takes less time.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ul>

<div class="smalltext">
The <b>Delay Budget</b> is made up of the sum of the delays.  In the UK, the total one-way delay budget
is typically less than 100ms.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Given two time sensitive packets e.g. voice packets, the End-to-End delay may be different for each of
those packets.  The difference between the delays i.e. variable delay, is known as <b>Jitter</b>. 
Both Delay and Jitter have a significant impact on Voice and Video
traffic, jitter often being more of a problem than delay.  In addition, both technologies can cope
with some packet loss, you don't for instance, wish to retransmit a part
of the conversation, instead it is better just to lose it or smooth it over.  Where video differs from voice is in its
bandwidth requirements.  Video is bandwidth hungry and bursty compared to voice which is steady and low in its bandwidth consumption.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Voice requires steady access where packets are evenly spaced (without Jitter) i.e. an Isochronous data flow in the same way that SDH works
where the cells that you want can be demuxed without the flow being stopped.  Traditional data networks do not operate
this way, we have to make a data network appear to operate in a way similar to SDH.
Some hardware manufacturers provide <b>Dejitter Buffers</b> that buffer packets as they are received
and then play them out as a steady stream thereby eliminating the variable delay.  The overall delay
is increased slightly as a result of implementing a de-jitter buffer.  Packets that arrive so late
that they fall outside of the de-jitter buffer are discarded.  DSPs may be implemented within
the equipment that perform an intelligent interpolation of the missing sound.  This minimises
the distortion cause by the dropped packets.
</div> 

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">1.5 Functions of QoS</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
QoS needs to enable:
</div>

<ul>
<li>Predictable Response times</li>
<li>Management of delay sensitive applications</li>
<li>Management of jitter sensitive applications</li>
<li>Control of packet loss when congestion occurs during a burst (note that continuous congestion means that the link is over-subscribed)</li>
<li>The setting of traffic priorities.</li>
<li>Dedication of bandwidth on a per application basis.</li>
<li>The avoidance of congestion</li>
<li>The management of congestion when it occurs, note that this is different from trying to avoid congestion, sometimes it is not possible
to avoid congestion.</li>
</ul>

<div class="smalltext">
QoS can be thought of as operating on one or more of three levels:
</div>

<ul>
<li><b>Best Effort</b></li>
<li><b>Differentiated Service</b> - can deal with differing levels of QoS on a packet by packet basis</li>
<li><b>Integrated Service</b> - requested level of service by an application to a network.  Data is only sent
after confirmation that the service level is guaranteed to be available.</li>
</ul> 

<div class="smalltext">
The order of events with respect to QoS can be described as follows:
</div>

<ol>
<li>Mark and Classify packets according to policies and the behaviour of the traffic.  This is carried out with technologies such
as IP Precedence and DSCP and is most effective when carried out as far to the edge of the network as possible, even at the device
itself (e.g. a VoIP phone).</li>
<li>Congestion management by prioritising traffic based on the marks using queuing technologies that can respond to traffic classes.</li>
<li>Avoid congestion by dropping packets that are not a high priority using technologies such as Random Early Detection where
low priority packets are weeded out of a queue so as to prevent indescriminant 'Tail Drop' of packets.</li>
<li>Police traffic so that bad packets are kept at bay i.e. limit the ingress or egress traffic depending on the class/markings
of the packets.  Also
perform traffic shaping to maximise the use of bandwidth by specifying peak and average traffic rates.</li>
<li>Fragment and compress packets to maximise the use of WAN bandwidths.</li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2 class="heading2">2. Marking and Classifying</h2>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">2.1 Layer 2 Class of Service (CoS)</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
As detailed in <a href="http://www.rhyshaden.com/eth_vlan.htm#802.1p">802.1p</a>, Layer 2 Class of Service can be provided within the TCI
field of the Ethernet frame.  The 3 bits give 8 different classes which have the values assigned as follows:
</div>

<ul>
<li><b>000</b> (0) - Routine</li>
<li><b>001</b> (1) - Priority</li>
<li><b>010</b> (2) - Immediate</li>
<li><b>011</b> (3) - Flash</li>
<li><b>100</b> (4) - Flash Override</li>
<li><b>101</b> (5) - Critical</li>
<li><b>110</b> (6) - Internetwork Control</li>
<li><b>111</b> (7) - Network Control</li>
</ul>

<div class="smalltext">
These map to the IP Precedence values in the TOS field of the IP datagram.  Layer 2 switches can have two or maybe four
queues per port which can be used when there is congestion, to put frames with particular CoS values into the appropriate queues
and perform a <b>Weighted Round Robin (WRR)</b> approach to servicing these queues.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
As illustated in <a href="http://www.rhyshaden.com/eth_vlan.htm#isl">ISL</a>, Cisco's ISL also has 3 bits allocated to priority values.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">2.2 IP Precedence and Differentiated Services (DiffServ)</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
DiffServ is concerned with classifying packets as they enter the local network.  This classification then applies to 
<b>Flow</b> of traffic where a Flow is defined by 5 elements; Source IP address, Destination IP, Source port, Destination port
and the transport protocol.  A flow that has been classified or marked can then be acted upon by other QoS mechanisms.
Multiple flows can therefore be dealt with in a multitude of ways depending on the requirements of each flow.  Packets
are first Classified according to their current DSCP.  Then they are separated into queues where one queue may be routed
via a marking mechanism and another queue may be examined more closely.  After further examination additional packets may be sent
for marking or be sent direct to the shaping/dropping mechanisms where all packets end up before leaving the interface.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
The IP header has a field called the <b>Type of Service (TOS)</b> that sits between the <b>Header Length</b> field and the
<b>Total Length</b> field.
(Refer to <a href="http://www.rhyshaden.com/ipdgram.htm#tos">IP Datagram TOS field</a> for a view of the Type Of Service field in the IP header.)
Traditionally, <b>IP Precedence</b> has used the first three bits of the TOS field to give 8 possible precedence values.
</div>

<ul>
<li><b>000</b> (0) - Routine</li>
<li><b>001</b> (1) - Priority</li>
<li><b>010</b> (2) - Immediate</li>
<li><b>011</b> (3) - Flash</li>
<li><b>100</b> (4) - Flash Override</li>
<li><b>101</b> (5) - Critical</li>
<li><b>110</b> (6) - Internetwork Control</li>
<li><b>111</b> (7) - Network Control</li>
</ul>

<div class="smalltext">
DiffServ introduces the concept of the <b>DiffServ Code Point (DSCP)</b> that uses the first 6 bits of the TOS field
thereby giving 2<sup>6</sup> = <b>64</b> different values.
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2474.txt" target="_blank">RFC 2474</a> describes the Differentiated Services (DS) field and the DiffServ Code Point
(DSCP).
</div>

<br>

<center>
<img src="./Quality of Service, diff serv code point, ip precedence_files/dscp.gif" alt="DSCP field">
</center>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
With DiffServ each router handles each packet differently.  The concept of <b>Per-Hop Forwarding Behaviour (PHB)</b>
is introduced where classes are developed such as Business, Telecommuter, Residential etc. that can be offered
by an ISP as different levels of service.  A Per-Hop Behaviour is effectively a way of forwarding a particular flow 
or group of flows (<b>Behaviour Aggregate</b>) of traffic on a DiffServ node.
A flow, or flows, of packets marked with a particular DSCP in the DS field will be subject to a particular method of forwarding and rules as
encapsulated in the <b>Behaviour Aggregate</b>.  This Aggregate has three elements to it (or three colours) which determine
whether the router interface 1) Drops the datagram, 2) Sends the datagram or 3) reclassifies it.  This three-colour
marker is detailed in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2697.txt" target="_blank">RFC 2697</a>.  For instance 5 flows can be treated
as a Behaviour Aggregate so they are treated similarly as a group in most respects.  Each flow is then distinguished
by an additional <b>Drop Probability</b> and <b>Forwarding Behaviour</b>.  Be aware that as the Drop Preference value
increases, so the probability of being dropped increases!

<h3 class="heading3">2.3 Integrated Services (IntServ)</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
<b>Integrated Services (IntServ)</b> is for the internal network which is more easy to control.
IntServ can deal with many QoS requirements at one time, the difference with IntServ wrt DiffServ, is that it specifies its
traffic requirements and the network sets up the requirements if they are possible, before traffic is sent.
If the network is unable to set up the transmission path then the call does not happen, so there is a form of
<b>Call Admission Control (CAC)</b> (see later).
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1633.txt" target="_blank">RFC 1633</a> describes IntServ.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
<b>Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)</b> fits in with the IntServ model and
is a signalling protocol that allows applications to request bandwidth and QoS
characteristics and provides a mechanism to tell if the network can meet the demands.  
This mechanism uses a sort of 'scout' that checks out the network ahead of data transmission.
Delay and Bandwidth can be reserved and flows can be signalled by the end station or the router.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
If a host makes a reservation for a data stream then each network device through the network attempts to make
a reservation to the next hop, this is called the Reservation Path.  A successful reservation is made if
the user has the permission and if there are enough resources to provide the QoS.  Once the destination is reached
the same is done for the return data stream so that there is a QoS path back.
With traditional RSVP, if just one network node says 'no' to a reservation, then no path is set up at all.
As well as accepting a reservation, RSVP also uses a 'Traffic Classifier' that uses DiffServ to instruct the
routers how to mark and treat each flow.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Once the data stream has completed, a PATHTEAR and RESVTEAR is triggered to terminate the call and release resources
back to the mainstream traffic.  The queues are structured such that The IntServ queue (RSVP) has the highest priority,
over and above the highest priority DiffServ queues.  Applications can use RSVP in combination with <b>Weighted Fair
Queuing (WFQ)</b> to provide <b>Guaranteed-Rate Service</b> so that a VoIP call can for instance reserve bandwidth.
In addition, applications can use RSVP in conjunction with a technology such as <b>Weighted Random
Early Detection (WRED)</b> to provide a <b>Controlled-Load Service</b> which provides low delay for video
playback for instance, even if there is congestion.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
It is now possible to synchronise RSVP call setup with the H.323 call setup between the <b>Originating Gateway (OGW)</b> and the
<b>Terminating Gateway (TGW)</b>.  The H.323 setup is suspended just before the destination phone rings.  During
this period the RSVP reservation is carried out in both directions between the OGW and the TGW because voice calls are 
two-way and require bandwidth in both directions.  Then H.323 kicks in again with either an H.225 Alerting/Connect
message (which causes the destination phone to ring) or an H.225 Reject/Release.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
802.1p, ToS and RSVP can be set per packet, or per port in a switch.

version of RSVP called <b>Proxy-RSVP</b> where a best-effort RSVP path can be set up using routers that do not
understand RSVP and would ordinarily cause the path to fail.
</div>

<br>

<h2 class="heading2">3. Congestion Management</h2>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">3.1 Queuing</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
When congestion occurs there needs to be way of sorting the traffic out.  Packets that have been marked can be identified
and placed in queues.  The queues can vary in how much and when they can load up the link with the packets contained
within their queue.  The shorter the queue length; the lower the latency.  Even the fastest of
links on the fastest of layer 2 switches can suffer from congestion if the data packets
are large.  The simplest method of queuing is <b>Round Robin (RR)</b> where each queue is serviced
one packet from each at a time.  Using IP precedence, higher priority traffic can be given
a low weight thereby allowing it access to greater bandwidth.  This is called <b>Weighted Round
Robin (WRR)</b>.  Adding a <b>Priority Queue (PQ)</b> allows you to always serve delay sensitive
traffic first.  If the priority queue is empty then RR or WRR operates as normal.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Companies such as Cisco have their own methods of dealing with congestion, here we will look
at how Cisco have developed their queuing mechanisms.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">3.2 First-in, First-out (FIFO)</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Whatever the size, the first packet to enter an interface is the first to leave that interface.  No queues are involved.
This is often the default mechanism for receiving and sending packets on an interface.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">3.3 Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
WFQ allocates bandwidth according to IP Precedence using weightings and the number of WFQ queues depend on the number of flows.
Routing protocols and LMI traffic bypass the WFQ mechanism.
WFQ respects the top priority queues used for RSVP.  Any queuing mechanism based on WFQ will preserve
'Reserved Queues' traditionally for RTP Reserve and now RSVP.  If RSVP is configured, then RSVP will use this reserved queue.
Reserved queue traffic is given a low weight of <b>4</b> which
means 'High priority'.  RSVP is initially given a weight of 128 whilst the reservation is set up, then the RSVP traffic is
given a weight of 4.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
IP traffic is classified based on source IP address and port, destination IP address and port and IP Precedence.
Frame Relay traffic uses the DLCI to classify traffic, IPX uses MAC addresses and socket numbers.
WFQ tries to interleave smaller packets between the larger packets.  The decision as to which packet in the queue
is allowed to go through is based on the first packet to finish entering the queue which therefore favours the
shorter packets, so low bandwidth traffic takes priority over high bandwidth traffic.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Once the priority queues have been serviced the other IP traffic is wieghted and queued accordingly.  The weighting factor is
dependent on the IP Precedence.  The way this is calculated is as follows:
</div>

<ul>
<li>Say you have three flows with IP precedences of P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>3</sub>.</li>
<li>Add up (P<sub>1</sub> + 1), (P<sub>2</sub> + 1) and (P<sub>3</sub> + 1).</li>
<li>Each flow will get a proportion of the link bandwidth e.g. the flow with P<sub>1</sub> will get the proportion
(P<sub>1</sub> + 1) / ((P<sub>1</sub> + 1) + (P<sub>2</sub> + 1) + (P<sub>3</sub> + 1)).</li>
</ul>

<div class="smalltext">
As an example, if the three flows had IP Precedences of 1, 3 and 5 then the flow with IP Precedence of 1 will get the 
proportion 2/12 whereas the flow with IP Precedence of 5 will get the proportion 6/12, which is half the bandwidth being
significantly more than 1/6 of the bandwidth.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
The problem with WFQ is that as the number of flows increases the higher priority flows have a less significant impact
as all the flows get served.  For instance, if there are 18 flows with IP Precedence of 1 and one each of IP Precedence
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, then the flow with IP Precedence 5 will get 6/70 of the link and 18 flows will each get 2/70 of the link.
There is now very little difference between the critical traffic and the lower priority traffic.
</div> 

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
WFQ across a number of interfaces is called Distributed Weighted Fair Queuing (DWFQ).
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">3.4 Priority Queuing (PQ)</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
This utilises <b>4</b> queues; <b>High</b>, <b>Medium</b>, <b>Normal</b> and <b>Low</b>.  Which queue a packet goes into is determined
by whatever classification that packet belongs to.  Unclassified traffic is placed into the Normal queue.  The higher queues have to be
emptied before the lower ones.  Potentially this could lead to lower queues being starved of time to empty, this is called <b>Protocol
Starvation</b>.  High priority traffic would be time critical
traffic such as DEC LAT or SNA and the packets in this queue would be forwarded before the packets in the other
queues.  Low priority traffic may not get forwarded at all.  If a queue becomes longer than the specified limit, then subsequent
packets trying to enter that queue are dropped indiscriminently (Tail Drop).
Priority queuing is a method whereby the engineer
can decide which packets are more likely to be thrown away rather than the router making indescriminant decisions.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
The top priority queue used for RSVP is not respected by PQ.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">3.5 Custom Queuing</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Custom Queuing provides the facility for up to 16 queues with varying priorities.
This method is used for assigning queue space per protocol.  Queue 0 is reserved for router to router communication
whilst queues 1 to 16 are for the user.  The router deals with each queue in a Weighted Round Robin fashion allowing the
configured amount of traffic from each so that no one queue monopolises the bandwidth.  Each queue has a default
length of 1518 bytes.  You need to characterise the average packet sizes for each protocol and then specify the byte count
and queue length for each queue.  If a particular queue is empty, then the extra space is dynamically shared out
amongst the other queues.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
The top priority queue used for RSVP is not respected by CQ.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">3.6 Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing (CBWFQ)</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
With CBWFQ you can manually define up to 64 traffic classes (including one which is the default class queue)
that determine the exact bandwidth that is allocated to certain traffic types.  With WFQ, a large number
of dynamic queues can still cause latency for high-priority traffic.  With CBWFQ each class is queued and dealt with
exhaustively so you can manually ensure that certain traffic such as voice will not suffer latency.
Classifying packets that need to be queued using WFQ does not guarantee that all packets will be serviced.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
The class is defined using criteria to match the traffic.  These criteria could be access control lists, protocols and interfaces.
You then add characteristics to this class of traffic by assigning bandwidth the maximum number of packets (queue limit) and a drop policy.
The weight is derived from the bandwidth that you specify and is used by the WFQ mechanism as described above
to provide guaranteed delivery.  Unclassified
traffic is assumed to be in the Default Class and is acted on by WFQ and is best-effort treated.  Non-IP traffic is assigned to flow 0.
If the number of packets from a matched flow exceed the queue limit, then by default tail drop occurs whereby the last packets get dropped.
for the drop policy, you can instead implement <b>Weighted Random Early Detect</b> for a particular class (WRED can also be
applied to an interface) so that certain more critical packets (higher precedence) are allowed into the queue and less criticial
packets dropped.  Unused bandwidth for one class is shared amongst the other classes.  The recommended maximum bandwidth set aside
within the defined classes is 75%.  This leaves room for routing protocols and layer 2 keepalives etc.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">3.7 IP RTP Priority</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
This has been known as PQ/WFQ, however the PQ is strictly IP RTP priority and no other protocols, so it is not PQ as
we have so far understood it so this method is only available for IP RTP traffic.
IP Real Time Protocol runs over UDP and gets serviced exhaustively first once the ports have been recognised.
The other queues are serviced by WFQ.  With IP RTP Priority
you get the benefit of still maintaining the top priority queue.  The UDP port range (<b>16384 - 32767</b>) used by RTP traffic
uses this top priority queue.  IP RTP Priority can also use CBWFQ as well as just WFQ which gives PQ/CBWFQ, however the PQ is strictly
for RTP traffic only.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
The port range 16384 to 32767 is a recommendation.  You could use other UDP ports if you wish, video traffic often does.
</div>


<h3 class="heading3">3.8 Frame Relay IP RTP Priority</h3>

<div class="smalltext">
This scheme uses a Frame Relay PVC to provide a strict priority queuing scheme for RTP traffic.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">3.9 Low Latency Queuing (LLQ)</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
LLQ is also known as PQ/CBWFQ.  Unlike IP RTP Priority, the single Priority Queue within
LLQ can deal with TCP exchanges as well and is therefore the preferred choice
to use when queuing all types of traffic.  If you configure IP RTP Priority as well as LLQ, then IP RTP Priority will take precedence.
You would then need to be careful not to put jitter sensitive traffic through both priority queues.
</div>

<br>

<h2 class="heading2">4. Congestion Avoidance</h2>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">4.1 Global Synchronisation</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
When an interface becomes busy, queues fill up and you are more likely to suffer <b>Tail Drop</b> where packets, however
they are marked, are dropped indiscriminently.  If there are multiple TCP flows through a congested link, then
chances are that many flows will be dropped at the same time.  The TCP slow-start mechanism will
then kick in at the same time for all the flows that were interrupted.  This leads to <b>Global
Synchronisation</b> where there are waves of congestion followed by waves of under utilisation
of the link which is not an efficient use of the link.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">4.2 Random Early Detection (RED)</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Rather than have flows dropped simultaneously a technique called Random Early Detection was developed.
This uses the concept of queue depth which is the amount that you fill a particular queue.
When the average queue depth reaches a <b>Minimum Threshold</b>, packets start to be dropped at a rate that is
determined by the <b>Mark Probability Denominator</b>.  If the Mark Probability Denominator is 512, then
if the average queue depth reaches the Minimum Threshold, 1 packet in every 512 is dropped.  As the queue
grows even larger, then the probability increases and consequently a larger percentage of the packets are dropped
until you reach the <b>Maximum Threshold</b> which is effectively the end of the queue where ALL
packets are dropped.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
The drops do not occur all at once and a session that was hit once, will not be hit again
until it starts responding.  This thereby minimises global synchronisation
and makes more efficient use the the link bandwidth during congestion.  An issue with RED
is that TCP sessions become slower and as TCP traffic drops off, the queues begin to fill
proportionally more with UDP traffic which means that there is an increased risk of UDP traffic
being dropped.  UDP does not respond well to drops, particularly voice and video traffic!
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">4.3 Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED)</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
WRED is Cisco's implementation of RED and adds the use of DSCP/IP Precedence to
enable you to weed out low-priority packets from the queue and to drop them
by giving these packets a higher drop probability.  When using the DSCP, WRED uses the Drop
Preference portion of the PHB to determine the Drop Probability.  This thereby
minimising the chances of tail-dropping high-priority packets.  Using WRED does not preclude the
chances of dropping voice packets (Class of Service/IP Precedence of <b>5</b>)
and therefore is not a recommended technology to use within a voice network.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Non-IP packets are treated as if they had an IP Precedence of 0, so making these packets the most likely
to be dropped.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
WRED does not like non-adaptive flows such as UDP because UDP does not mind if it gets dropped whereas TCP has its own
built in mechanisms to throttle back.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">4.4 Flow-Based Weighted Random Early Detection (FRED)</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
A flow is made up of a 5-tuple of source address and port, destination address and port, and IP Precedence.
FRED can track flows and penalise those flows that take up more than their fair share of the buffer
space.  FRED does this by looking at each flow in turn and observing how each one uses the queues.
FRED then allows some bursting space by scaling up the number of packets allowed for each flow
in the queues and then waits to see if any flows exceed this number.  If a particular flow does exceed
the number of packets allowed, FRED increases the probability of packets from that flow being dropped.

<h2 class="heading2">5. Link Efficiency</h2>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Smaller data packets used for applications such as voice and telnet are susceptible to jitter (delay
variation)
when large data packets are traversing the same interfaces.  <b>Link Fragmentation and Interleaving
(LFI)</b> at layer 2
is a mechanism whereby large packets are fragmented and the smaller data packets interleaved with the
fragments.  You need to be able to control the serialisation delay of the data fragments so that there
is a maximum time the delay-sensitive packets have to wait if they are caught in a queue behind a
data fragment.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
<b>Serialisation Delay</b> is the time it takes for an interface to push bits out on to the circuit.  
Only one packet can be dealt with at a time (the nature of serial transmission).  If the circuit speed
is high e.g. 768 Kbps, then a 1500 byte data frame would take 1500 x 8/768000 = 16ms to be pushed on to the circuit.
The same size frame on a 56 Kbps modem link would take 1500 x 8/56000 = 214ms.  The maximum acceptable end-to-end delay for delay
sensitive traffic such as voice is generally considered to be 150ms (G.114 standard) and the Serialisation delay is only one of the factors
involved in the end-to-end delay.  On a slow link such as 56 Kbps a small packet such as 128 bytes would only take
128 x 8/56000 = 18ms, however a large packet that is before it will hold up the smaller packet.
This shows how damaging large packet sizes are on slow links due to the delay and jitter they incurr
for small packets trying to get through.  Aim for a serialisation delay of not more than 10ms (20ms max).
You do this by decreasing the packet size and/or increasing the link speed.  The following table
is a useful guide of fragment size recommendation compared with link speed assuming a 10ms blocking
delay.

<div class="smalltext">
In a Voice over IP environment
Real-Time Transport Protocol is an Internet standard (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1889.txt" target="_blank">RFC 1889</a>)
used to transport real-time data.  Whereas TCP is used for signalling protocols such as H.323,
RTP uses UDP for transport because if packets get lost, there is no point in re-sending the data.
The RTP header is 12 bytes in length and follows the 8-byte UDP header and the 20-byte IP header.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
When using RTP, a technique called <b>Compressed RTP (cRTP)</b> can be utilised whereby the IP header, UDP header and the RTP header can be
compressed from the usual 40 bytes down to between 2-4 bytes.  This is suitable for point-to-point links, preferably
using hardware for the compression.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
If speech is sampled every 20ms then you end up with a VoIP payload of 20 bytes.  Comparing this to the 40-byte (12 + 8 + 20)
VoIP header you can see that the header is twice the size of the payload.  Using cRTP compresses this 40-byte
header to between 2 and 5 bytes.  This is useful for small payload voice protocols such as G.729 where
a typical voice call without cRTP would be 26.4Kbps whereas with cRTP this reduces to 11.2Kbps.
cRTP is used on an link by link basis and is typically implemented
in software rather than hardware so the CPU is loaded heavily when using cRTP.  This, together
with the benefits being most apparent on slow links, means that cRTP ought only to be used with slow links i.e.
less than 768Kbps.
</div>

<br>

<h2 class="heading2">6. Traffic Policing</h2>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Conditioning traffic that enters a network can be carried out by controlling bursty traffic and making sure that designated
traffic flows get the correct bandwidth.  This can often mean 'chopping' off the excess flows, or changing the Precedence
of the packets that exceed the bandwidth.  Policing <b>ingress</b> traffic causes TCP resends.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
The concept of <b>Token Bucket</b> or <b>Leaky Bucket</b> is used when looking at Traffic Policing or Traffic Shaping.
Taking concepts from Frame Relay <b>Mean Rate (CIR) = Burst Size (B<sub>c</sub>) / Time Interval (T<sub>c</sub>)</b>.
Imagine a bucket which is being filled with tokens at a rate.  The bucket has a capacity
<b>B<sub>c</sub></b> + <b>B<sub>e</sub></b> and each token has permission to send a fixed number of bits.
When a packet arrives if it matches the class for that bucket then it is added to the queue
and released from the queue according to the specified rate if there are enough tokens available in the
bucket.  If the bucket fills to capacity then new tokens are discarded ('leaked' out)
and cannot be retrieved for use
by subsequent packets.  If there are not enough tokens in the bucket, then the system may wait
for enough tokens before sending the packet (this is traffic shaping) or
the packet may be discarded (traffic policing).
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
The token bucket methodology means that any bursts are limited to the bucket capacity and the
transmission rate is governed by the rate at which tokens are added to the bucket.
</div>

<br>

<h2 class="heading2">7. Traffic Shaping</h2>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Traffic can also be conditioned by 'Shaping' it rather than use more brutal policing techniques.  Shaping the traffic 
means that traffic is 'smoothed' out using queues to hold up packets just delaying them until there is a trough.
The leaky bucket provides a buffer of tokens that can deal with controlled bursts.
This is done on <b>egress</b> traffic rather than ingress.
<b>Frame Relay Traffic Shaping (FRTS)</b> is a good example where the CIR is adhered to by holding back packets
during a burst so as to let them go during the next quiet period, maybe even allowing occasional bursting provided that the average
utilisation is adhered to over a specified period of time.  Cisco use the concept of <b>Generic Traffic Shaping</b> 
when applying traffic shaping principles within a much broader context such as the IP environment.  The trouble with
Traffic Shaping is that it introduces latency.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Shaping traffic is important if you have mismatched link speeds at each end e.g. a Frame Relay
hub-spoke arrangement where you do not want to oversubscribe the hub site and risk packets being dropped
in the cloud because you exceed the CIR at one end.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
<b>Generic Traffic Shaping (GTS)</b> can be applied to any outbound interface and operates
with SMDS, ATM, Frame Relay and Ethernet.  Outbound traffic can be shaped to meet the requirements
of the receiving device(s), DSCPs can be set, BECNs listened to and access lists can be used to
determine the traffic to shape.
</div>

<br>

<h2 class="heading2">8. Call Admission Control (CAC)</h2>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">8.1 Overview</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Voice and Video traffic, or calls, can be restricted by way of CAC tools that determine whether or not there is sufficient bandwidth.
One too many calls on a link would cause the quality of the other calls to suffer so the extra call is prohibited.  CAC's use
is to prevent congestion from voice and video occurring in the first place, before Quality of Service tools are called into play.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
CAC can be implemented in a number of ways:
</div>

<ul>
<li>Locally - i.e. at the originating gateway, by limiting the DS0s (not for IPT), the maximum number of connections,
bandwidth on Voice over Frame Relay, Trunk Conditioning and Local Voice Busyout (LVBO).</li>
<li>Based on measurement - PSTN Fallback or Advanced Voice Busyout (AVBO)</li>
<li>Based on available resources - Resource Availability Indicator (RAI), H.323 Gatekeeper zone bandwidth or RSVP.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">8.2 Local CAC</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Local CAC is not aware of the topology of the network and cannot guarantee QoS.  Benefits include no messaging overhead
and no delay.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Limiting DS0s (timeslots) between the PBX and the originating gateway is a simple method that applies to toll bypass
scenarios only.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
In a Cisco IPT environment you can limit the number of concurrent VoIP connections on a per dial peer basis so that in total
the trunk link will have a total limit.  If a particular dial peer has calls directed to <b>477...</b> then if you limited
the number of simultaneous calls to 5, any further calls will be 'hairpinned' back to the PBX and the PSTN would be used for
the excess call(s).
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
In VoFR networks FRF.11 is used to packetize voice.  At layer 2 it is therefore possible to distinguish between the 
Frame Relay data header (FRF.3.1) and the Frame Relay Voice header (FRF.11) and so provide CAC disallowing calls that exceed
the bandwidth allocated to voice calls.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
On a VoFR, VoATM or VoIP point-to-point connection you can nail down voice connections, this is called <b>Connection Trunk</b>.
If the trunk link uses <b>Channel Associated Signalling (CAS)</b> (a robbed bit technology common in the US), then you use
the A, B, C and D bits as keepalives for each channel.  On detection of a channel failing or being busy, a <b>Busy</b>
or <b>Out of Service (OOS)</b> signal can be sent back to the PBX in a form that the PBX understands.  This is called
<b>Trunk Conditioning</b> and does not work with Common Channel Signalling (CCS).
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
<b>Local Voice Busyout (LVBO)</b> is used to monitor LAN and WAN ports for failure and then to busy out voice ports
or the trunk to the PBX.  This is used for analogue or CAS trunks.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">8.3 Measurement-Based CAC</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Measurement-Based CAC is not topology-aware nor does it guarantee QoS.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Cisco have a proprietary Client-Server (Responder) protocol called the <b>Service Assurance Agent (SAA)</b> which gives an indication of
network conditions by generating traffic and measuring response times, jitter, connect time, packet loss, availability and
application performance.  These indicators frequently form the basis for Service Level Agreements.  Originally designed for SNA traffic
it has been extended to simulate VoIP and Web traffic.  An RTP/UDP header is used for VoIP simulation and the SAA operates by the
client sending a probe to a server that responds.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Two factors <b>Delay</b> and <b>Packet Loss</b> are used by the SAA to calculate the ITU G.113 <b>International Calculated
Planning Impairment Factor (ICPIF)</b> for an application on a given network.  This value can be used to make CAC
decisions.  The ITU use the following guideline values:
</div>

<ul>
<li><b>5</b> - Very good</li>
<li><b>10</b> - Good</li>
<li><b>20</b> - Adequate</li>
<li><b>30</b> - Limiting Case</li>
<li><b>45</b> - Exceptional limiting case</li>
<li><b>55</b> - Customers likely to react strongly</li>
</ul>

<div class="smalltext">
<b>Advanced Busy Out (AVBO)</b> supports H.323, MGCP and SIP environments and can busy out voice ports or trunks based
on ICPIF values.  The measurements are obviously IP-based.  AVBO only works with Analogue and CAS trunks.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
<b>PSTN Fallback</b> also uses SAA and applies to individual call setups.  IP adresses are cached along with their ICPIF
values so that SAA probes are only required on an initial call to a new IP address (therefore introducing
a postdial delay just for the new entry).  PSTN Fallback is useful because it busies out individual calls rather
than ports or the trunk, so it is not so brutal. You cannot use PSTN Fallback with RSVP.
</div>

<br>

<h3 class="heading3">8.4 Resource-Based CAC</h3>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Techniques such as <b>Resource Availability Indicator (RAI)</b> and <b>Gatekeeper Zone Bandwidth</b> examine the resources
at the time of the call request and then make a single CAC decision at that time.  The resources examined will include
available timeslots, Gateway CPU use, memory use, DSP use and bandwidth availability.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
Techniques such as <b>Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)</b> just look at bandwidth availability and reserves bandwidth
and guarantees QoS for the call duration.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
RAI is used in H.323 networks with a Gatekeeper.  The Gateway informs the Gatekeeper when it is running low on resources.
This is determined by configuring a low water mark and a high water mark.  The Gateway sends an RAI when the resources
fall below the low water mark and when the resources rise above the high water mark.  The Gatekeeper then makes routing decisions
based on these RAIs.
</div>

<br>

<div class="smalltext">
In an H.323 Gatekeeper environment, gatekeepers can be grouped into zones.  The gatekeeper in each zone can limit bandwidth
usage within its own zone and also between its own zone and other zones.  In a single zone the gatekeeper limits the bandwidth
allocation to the smallest link between the gateways within its zone, because the bandwidth limitation is configured per zone.
This not very efficient as some links within the zone with larger bandwidths can carry more calls, and this also applies
to where you have multiple zones with multiple gateways to each zone
and the gatekeepers limit calls to the number that can be carried on the smallest links to each of the zone, even if there
are larger links to each zone that could be used.  Using Gatekeeper CAC is the only method available in distributed H.323 zone environments.

                        image profile, and may result in the loss of installed
                        VIBs. The common vibs between host and image profile
                        will be skipped. To preserve installed VIBs, use
                        profile update instead. WARNING: If your installation
                        requires a reboot, you need to disable HA first.

  install               Installs VIB packages from a URL or depot. VIBs may be
                        installed, upgraded, or downgraded. WARNING: If your
                        installation requires a reboot, you need to disable HA
                        first.

Cmd options:
  -d|--depot=[ <str> ... ]
                        Specifies full remote URLs of the depot index.xml or
                        server file path pointing to an offline bundle .zip
                        file.
  --dry-run             Performs a dry-run only. Report the VIB-level
                        operations that would be performed, but do not change
                        anything in the system.
  -f|--force            Bypasses checks for package dependencies, conflicts,
                        obsolescence, and acceptance levels. Really not
                        recommended unless you know what you are doing. Use of
                        this option will result in a warning being displayed

Cmd options:



Usage: esxcli storage core adapter rescan [cmd options]

Description: 
  rescan                Rescan SCSI HBAs to search for new Devices, remove
                        DEAD paths and update path state. This operation will
                        also run an claim operation equivalent to the
                        claimrule run command and a filesystem rescan.

Cmd options:
  -A|--adapter=<str>    Select the adapter to use when rescanning SCSI
                        adapters. This must be a SCSI HBA name as shown in the
                        adapter list command. This cannot be used with the
                        --all option
  -a|--all              Indicate the rescan should rescan all adapters instead
                        of a specific one.
  -S|--skip-claim       By default after an add operation a claiming session
                        is run to find new devices and have them be claimed by
                        the appropriate Multipath Plugin. Passing this flag
                        will skip that claiming session.
  -F|--skip-fs-scan     This option is deprecated as no filesystem scan is
                        performed by default
  -t|--type=<str>       Specify the type of rescan to perform. Available types
                        are
                            add: Perform rescan and only add new devices if
                        any.
                            all: Perform rescan and do all opertaions (this is
                        the default action.)
                            delete: Perform rescan and only delete DEAD
                        devices.
                            update: Rescan existing paths only and update path
                        states.



Usage: esxcli storage core adapter stats get [cmd options]

Description: 
  get                   List the SCSI stats for the SCSI Host Bus Adapters in
                        the system.

Cmd options:
  -a|--adapter=<str>    Limit the stats output to one adapter



Usage: esxcli storage core claiming autoclaim [cmd options]

Description: 
  autoclaim             Control the automatic PSA (path/device) claiming code
                        allowing the disabling of the automatic claiming
                        process or re-enabling of the claiming process if it
                        was previously disabled. By default the automatic PSA
                        claiming process is on and should not be disabled by
                        users unless specifically instructed to do so.

Cmd options:
  -c|--claimrule-class=<str>
                        Indicate the claim rule class to use in this operation
                        [MP, Filter, VAAI, all].
  --enabled             Set the autoclaiming enabled state for a givenPSA
                        plugin type in the VMkernel. Default is to have this
                        process enabled. This should not be changed by users
                        unless specifically instructed to do so. (required)
  -w|--wait             If the --wait flag is provided then the autoclaim
                        enable will wait for paths to 'settle' before running
                        the claim operation.  This means that the system is
                        reasonably sure that all paths on the system have
                        appeared before enabling autoclaim.



Usage: esxcli storage core claiming reclaim [cmd options]

Description: 
  reclaim               Attempt to unclaim all paths to a device and then run
                        the loaded claimrules on each of the paths unclaimed
                        to attempt to reclaim them.

Cmd options:
  -d|--device=<str>     Reclaim requires the name of a device on which all
                        paths will be unclaimed and then reclaimed. (required)



Usage: esxcli storage core claiming unclaim [cmd options]

Description: 
  unclaim               1) Unclaim a path or set of paths, disassociating them
                        from a PSA plugin. NOTES:  It is normal for path
                        claiming to fail especially when unclaiming by plugin
                        or adapter. Only inactive paths with no I/O  will be
                        able to be unclaimed. Typically the ESXi USB partition
                        and devices with VMFS volumes on them will not be
                        unclaimable. Also NOTE unclaiming will not persist and
                        periodic path claiming will reclaim these paths in the
                        near future unless claim rules are configured to mask
                        the path. 2) Detach a (set of) filter(s) from one or
                        more devices.

Cmd options:
  -A|--adapter=<str>    If the --type paramter is 'location' this value
                        indicates the name of the host bus adapter for the
                        paths you wish to unclaim. This parameter can be
                        omitted to indicate unclaiming should be run on paths
                        from all adapters.
  -C|--channel=<long>   If the --type parameter is 'location' this value
                        indicates the value of the SCSI channel number for the
                        paths you wish to unclaim. This parameter can be
                        omitted to indicate unclaiming should be run on paths
                        with any channel number.
  -c|--claimrule-class=<str>
                        Indicate the claim rule class to use in this operation

  -d|--device=<str>     If the --type parameter is 'device' attempt to unclaim
                        all paths to a specific device (for multipathing
                        plugins) or unclaim the device itself (for filter
                        plugins). NOTE. For paths, if there are any active I/O
                        operations on this device, at least 1 path will fail
                        to unclaim.
  -D|--driver=<str>     If the --type parameter is 'driver' attempt to unclaim
                        all paths provided by a specific HBA driver.
  -L|--lun=<long>       If the --type parameter is 'location' this value
                        indicates the value of the SCSI Logical Unit Number
                        (LUN) for the paths you wish to unclaim. This
                        parameter can be omitted to indicate unclaiming should
                        be run on paths with any Logical Unit Number. If
                        passed, this value must not be higher than the value
                        of the advanced config option /Disk/MaxLUN
  -m|--model=<str>      If the --type parameter is 'vendor' attempt to unclaim
                        all paths to devices with specific model info (for
                        multipathing plugins) or unclaim the device itself
                        (for filter plugins). NOTE. For paths, if there are
                        any active I/O operations on this device, at least 1
                        path will fail to unclaim.
  -p|--path=<str>       If the --type parameter is 'path' attempt to unclaim a
                        specific path given its path UID or runtime name.
  -P|--plugin=<str>     If the --type parameter is 'plugin' attempt to unclaim
                        all paths on for a given multipath plugin OR all
                        devices attached to a filter plugin.
  -T|--target=<long>    If the --type paramter is 'location' this value
                        indicates the value of the SCSI target number for the
                        paths you wish to unclaim. This parameter can be
                        omitted to indicate unclaiming should be run on paths
                        with any target number.
  -t|--type=<str>       Indicate the type of unclaim you wish to perform.
                        Valid values for this paramter are  [location, path,
                        driver, device, plugin, vendor] (required)
  -v|--vendor=<str>     If the --type parameter is 'vendor' attempt to unclaim
                        all paths to devices with specific vendor info (for
                        multipathing plugins) or unclaim the device itself
                        (for filter plugins). NOTE. For paths, if there are
                        any active I/O operations on this device, at least 1
                        path will fail to unclaim.

                        characters. Format is: community1[,community2,...]

  -e|--enable           Start or stop SNMP service. Values: [yes|no,
                        true|false, 0|1]

                        hrStorageUsed in hrStorageTable. Setting this
                        directive to 1 to support large storage with small
                        allocation units, the agent re-calculates these values
                        so they all fit Integer32 and hrStorageAllocationUnits
                        * hrStorageSize gives real size of the storage ( Note:
                        hrStorageAllocationUnits will not be real allocation
                        units if real hrStorageSize won't fit into Integer32
                        ). Setting this directive to 0 turns off this
                        calculation and the agent reports real
                        hrStorageAllocationUnits, but it might report wrong
                        hrStorageSize for large storage because the value
                        won't fit into Integer32.

                        and not responding to normal stop operations.

Cmd options:
  -t|--type=<str>       The type of kill operation to attempt. There are three

                        hard, force]. Users should always attempt 'soft' kills
                        first, which will give the VMX process a chance to
                        shutdown cleanly (like kill or kill -SIGTERM). If that
                        does not work move to 'hard' kills which will shutdown
                        the process immediately (like kill -9 or kill
                        -SIGKILL). 'force' should be used as a last resort

  getdefault            Get default VSAN storage policy values.

Cmd options:
  -c|--policy-class=<str>
                        VSAN policy class whose default value to get. If not
                        provided, defaults for all classes will be retrieved.
                        Options are:  [cluster, vdisk, vmnamespace, vmswap,
                        vmem].



Usage: esxcli vsan policy setdefault [cmd options]

Description: 
  setdefault            Set default VSAN storage policy values.

Cmd options:
  -p|--policy=<str>     VSAN policy to set as default, in the form of a
                        string. Options are:
                        1)cacheReservation - Flash capacity reserved as read
                        cache for the storage object. Specified as a
                        percentage of the logical size of the object. To be
                        used only for addressing read performance issues.
                        Reserved flash capacity cannot be used by other
                        objects. Unreserved flash is shared fairly among all
                        objects. It is specified in parts per million.
                        Default value: 0, Maximum value: 1000000.
                        2)forceProvisioning - If this option is "1" the object
                        will be provisioned even if the policy specified in
                        the storage policy is not satisfiable with the
                        resources currently available in the cluster. Virtual
                        SAN will try to bring the object into compliance if
                        and when resources become available.
                        Default value: 0.
                        3)hostFailuresToTolerate - Defines the number of host,
                        disk, or network failures a storage object can
                        tolerate. When the fault tolerance method is
                        mirroring: to tolerate "n" failures, "n+1" copies of
                        the object are created and "2n+1" hosts contributing
                        storage are required (if fault domains are configured,
                        "2n+1" fault domains with hosts contributing storage
                        are required). When the fault tolerance method is
                        erasure coding: to tolerate 1 failure, 4 hosts (or
                        fault domains) are required; and to tolerate 2
                        failures, 6 hosts (or fault domains) are required.
                        Note: A host which is not part of a fault domain is
                        counted as its own single-host fault domain.
                        Default value: 1, Maximum value: 3.
                        4)stripeWidth - The number of HDDs across which each
                        replica of storage object is striped. A value higher
                        than 1 may result in better performance (for e.g when
                        flash read cache misses need to get serviced from
                        HDD), but also results in higher used of system
                        resources.
                        Default value: 1, Maximum value: 12.
                        5)proportionalCapacity - Percentage of the logical
                        size of the storage object that will be reserved
                        (thick provisioning) upon VM provisioning. The rest of
                        the storage object is thin provisioned.
                        Default value: 0%, Maximum value: 100%.
                        6)iopsLimit - Defines upper IOPS limit for a disk. IO
                        rate that has been serviced on a disk will be measured
                        and if the rate exceeds the IOPS limit, IO will be
                        delayed to keep it under the limit. Zero value means
                        no limit.
                        Default value: 0.
                        7)replicaPreference - Defines the method used to
                        tolerate failures. RAID-1 achieves failure tolerance
                        using mirrors, which provides better performance.
                        RAID-5/6 achieves failure tolerance using parity
                        blocks, which provides better space efficiency.
                        RAID-5/6 is only available on All-flash and when the
                        number of failures to tolerate is set to 1 or 2: a
                        value of 1 implies a RAID-5 configuration, and a value
                        of 2 implies a RAID-6 configuration.
                        Default value: RAID-1.
